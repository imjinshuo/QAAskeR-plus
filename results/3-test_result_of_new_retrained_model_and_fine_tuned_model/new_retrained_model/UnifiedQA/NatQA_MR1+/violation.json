phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid , onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked . purines , however , are - - nucleic acid metabolism - are both primarily produced in the liver . they both contain a sugar and a phosphate , but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes . because of this , the two different groups are synthesized in different ways . however , all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide . adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines . in purine synthesis , prpp is turned into inosine monophosphate , or imp . production of imp from prpp requires glutamine , glycine , aspartate , and 6 atp , among other things . imp is then converted to amp ( adenosine - - purine nucleoside phosphorylase - nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . purine nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . pnp metabolizes inosine into hypoxanthine and guanosine into guanine , in each case creating ribose phosphate . note : adenosine is first metabolized to inosine via the enzyme adenosine deaminase . nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme which cleaves a nucleoside by phosphorylating the ribose to produce a nucleobase and ribose 1 phosphate . it is one enzyme of the nucleotide salvage pathways . these pathways allow the cell to produce nucleotide monophosphates when the " de novo " synthesis pathway has been interrupted or is non -
