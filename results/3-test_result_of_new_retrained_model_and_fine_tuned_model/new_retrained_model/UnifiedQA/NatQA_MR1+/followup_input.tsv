What is generated by the group of cells that control the natural resting heart rate found ? \n - heart rate - at rest . bradycardia is a slow heart rate , defined as below 60 bpm at rest . during sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40 – 50 bpm is common and is considered normal . when the heart is not beating in a regular pattern , this is referred to as an arrhythmia . abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease . while heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions , heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node . the accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing norepinephrine onto the cells of the sinoatrial node - - cardiac pacemaker - and eventual action potential in contractile cells . having cardiomyocytes connected via gap junctions allow all contractile cells of the heart to act in a coordinated fashion and contract as a unit . all the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells ; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes . cells in the sa node spontaneously depolarize , ultimately resulting in contraction , approximately 100 times per minute . this native rate is constantly modified by the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers via the autonomic nervous system , so that the average resting cardiac rate - - heart rate - persons with coronary artery disease . the heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node . it is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves . nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata . the cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves , and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve . during rest , both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart , contributing to autonomic tone . this is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles . normally , vagal stimulation - - heart rate - stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ach ) at the neuromuscular junction . ach slows hr by opening chemical - or ligand - gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization , which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs . without any nervous stimulation , the sa node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm . since resting rates are considerably less than this , it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows hr . this is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal . to speed up , one need merely remove one ’ s foot from - - heart arrhythmia - muscle cell firing off an impulse on its own . all of the cells in the heart have the ability to initiate an action potential ; however , only some of these cells are designed to routinely trigger heart beats . these cells are found in the conduction system of the heart and include the sa node , av node , bundle of his and purkinje fibers . the sinoatrial node is a single specialized location in the atrium that has a higher automaticity ( a faster pacemaker ) than the rest of the heart and , therefore , is usually responsible for setting the heart rate and initiating each heart - - cardiac pacemaker - cardiac pacemaker the contraction of cardiac muscle ( heart muscle ) in all	the heart rate

The motive for the modern usage of this method and the person used a question and answer method of arriving at important truths ' use is not necessarily what ? \n - socratic method - socratic method the socratic method , also known as maieutics , method of elenchus , elenctic method , or socratic debate , is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals , based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions . it is a dialectical method , involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned ; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way , thus weakening the defender ' s point . this method is named after the classical greek philosopher socrates and is introduced by him in plato ' s theaetetus as midwifery ( maieutics ) - - socratic method - a paradox , and began using the socratic method to answer his conundrum . diogenes laertius , however , wrote that protagoras invented the “ socratic ” method . plato famously formalized the socratic elenctic style in prose — presenting socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent athenian interlocutor — in some of his early dialogues , such as " euthyphro " and " ion " , and the method is most commonly found within the so - called " socratic dialogues " , which generally portray socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and epistemological issues . but in his later dialogues , such as theaetetus or sophist , plato had a different method to philosophical discussions , namely - - socratic questioning - socratic questioning socratic questioning ( or socratic maieutics ) was named after socrates , who was a philosopher in c . 470 bce – c . 399 bce . socrates utilized an educational method that focused on discovering answers by asking questions from his students . socrates believed that " the disciplined practice of thoughtful questioning enables the scholar / student to examine ideas and be able to determine the validity of those ideas " . plato , a student of socrates , described this rigorous method of teaching to explain that the teacher assumes an ignorant mindset in order to compel the student to assume the highest level of knowledge . thus , a student - - socratic method - " logos " ) and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances . in the second half of the 5th century bc , sophists were teachers who specialized in using the tools of philosophy and rhetoric to entertain , impress , or persuade an audience to accept the speaker ' s point of view . socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching which came to be called the socratic method . socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow athenians after his friend from youth , chaerephon , visited the oracle of delphi , which confirmed that no man in greece was wiser than socrates . socrates saw this as - - socratic method - with moral truth and moral understanding , that " wealth does not bring goodness , but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing , both to the individual and to the state " , and that " life without examination [ dialogue ] is not worth living " . it is with this in mind that the socratic method is employed . the motive for the modern usage of this method and socrates ' use are not necessarily equivalent . socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories , instead using myth to explain them . the parmenides dialogue	equivalent

Who requisitioned troops from the thing had more power over taxation under the articles of confederation during the revolutionary war ? \n - articles of confederation - loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation . this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris would later be resolved by the implementation of jay ' s treaty in 1795 , after the federal constitution came into force . under the articles of confederation , the central government ' s power was kept quite limited . the confederation congress could make decisions , but lacked enforcement powers . implementation of most decisions , including modifications to the articles , required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures . congress was denied any powers of taxation : it could only request money from the states . the states often failed to meet these requests in full , - - articles of confederation - articles of confederation the articles of confederation , formally the articles of confederation and perpetual union , was an agreement among the 13 original states of the united states of america that served as its first constitution . it was approved , after much debate ( between july 1776 and november 1777 ) , by the second continental congress on november 15 , 1777 , and sent to the states for ratification . the articles of confederation came into force on march 1 , 1781 , after being ratified by all 13 states . a guiding principle of the articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states . the central government - - articles of confederation - to leave philadelphia temporarily . the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states . any contributions were voluntary , and in the debates of 1788 the federalists ( who supported the proposed new constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally , and contributed when the continental army protected their state ' s interests . the anti - federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs . dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the states ' behavior validated the federalist analysis . this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms . the 1783 treaty of paris , which ended - - articles of confederation - institutional structures of the congress , and the propensity to divide along sectional lines . rakove ( 1988 ) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation . the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power . it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island . rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures " stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes , mustering men , and gathering supplies from - - articles of confederation - to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict . at what came to be known as the annapolis convention , the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in philadelphia in may 1787 to discuss ways to improve the articles of confederation in a " grand convention .

What is the tcp / ip the location ipsec reside in a protocol stack in fact ? \n - internet layer - that may have occurred to the data in each packet . ipv6 does not include this header checksum , instead relying on the link layer to assure data integrity for the entire packet including the checksum . the primary protocols in the internet layer are the internet protocol ( ip ) . it is implemented in two versions , ipv4 and ipv6 . the internet control message protocol ( icmp ) is primarily used for error and diagnostic functions . different implementations exist for ipv4 and ipv6 . the internet group management protocol ( igmp ) is used by ipv4 hosts and adjacent multicast routers to establish multicast group memberships . internet protocol security ( ipsec ) - - internet layer - is a suite of protocols for securing internet protocol ( ip ) communications by authenticating and encrypting each ip packet in a data stream . ipsec also includes protocols for cryptographic key establishment . ipsec was originally designed as a base specification in ipv6 in 1995 , and later adapted to ipv4 , with which it has found widespread use in securing virtual private networks . despite clear primary references and normative standards documents , the internet layer is often improperly called " network layer " . this is done because the internet layer of the tcp / ip model is easily compared directly with the network layer ( layer 3 ) in the open - - transport layer - internet all originated in the development of tcp / ip . in the osi model the transport layer is often referred to as layer 4 , or l4 , while numbered layers are not used in tcp / ip . the best - known transport protocol of tcp / ip is the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , and lent its name to the title of the entire suite . it is used for connection - oriented transmissions , whereas the connectionless user datagram protocol ( udp ) is used for simpler messaging transmissions . tcp is the more complex protocol , due to its stateful design incorporating reliable transmission and data stream services . other protocols in this group are the datagram - - spanning tree protocol - address will be the root . for example , if switches a ( mac = 0200 . 0000 . 1111 ) and b ( mac = 0200 . 0000 . 2222 ) both have a priority of 32768 then switch a will be selected as the root bridge . if the network administrators would like switch b to become the root bridge , they must set its priority to be less than 32768 . the sequence of events to determine the best received bpdu ( which is the best path to the root ) is : breaking ties for root ports : when multiple paths from a bridge are least - cost paths , the chosen path uses the neighbor bridge with the lower bridge id . the root - - network layer - model has a layer called the internet layer , located above the link layer . in many textbooks and other secondary references , the tcp / ip internet layer is equated with the osi network layer . however , this comparison is misleading , as the allowed characteristics of protocols ( e . g . , whether they are connection - oriented or connection - less ) placed into these layers are different in the two models . the tcp / ip internet layer is in fact only a	only a

How many challenges does the thing would need to happen to change a lead atom into a gold atom present ? \n - heterogeneous gold catalysis - are obtained by partial oxidation of alkanes and alkenes with dioxygen . these intermediates are essential to the production of consumer goods . partial oxidation presents two challenges . the first is that the most favored reaction between oxygen and hydrocarbons is combustion . the second challenge is the considerable difficulty to activate dioxygen , viz . the splitting of the molecule into its constituent atoms , which has an energy barrier of 498 kj / mol . the usual strategy to activate oxygen in a controlled manner is to use molecular hydrogen or carbon monoxide as sacrificial reductants in presence of a heterogeneous catalyst , such that the activation barrier - - transmutation of species - geologist charles lyell , was intense . the debate over them was an important stage in the history of evolutionary thought and would influence the subsequent reaction to darwin ' s theory . transmutation was one of the names commonly used for evolutionary ideas in the 19th century before charles darwin published " on the origin of species " ( 1859 ) . transmutation had previously been used as a term in alchemy to describe the transformation of base metals into gold . other names for evolutionary ideas used in this period include " the development hypothesis " ( one of the terms used by darwin ) and " the theory of regular gradation " , used by - - nuclear transmutation - the abundance of all elements heavier than boron . in their 1957 paper " synthesis of the elements in stars " , william alfred fowler , margaret burbidge , geoffrey burbidge , and fred hoyle explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of nucleosynthesis in stars . it transpired that , under true nuclear transmutation , it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction , which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued . nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold , but the expense far exceeds any gain . it would be easier to convert - - gold - which are used in mining and electroplating . gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . a relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history . in the past , a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy , but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s , and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971 . a total of 186 , 700 tonnes of gold exists above ground , . the world consumption of new - - gold - with hydrofluoric , hydrochloric , hydrobromic , hydriodic , sulfuric , or nitric acid . it does react with selenic acid , and is dissolved by aqua regia , a 1 : 3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid . nitric acid oxidizes the metal to + 3 ions , but only in minute amounts , typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction . however , the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid , forming aucl ions , or chloroauric acid , thereby enabling further oxidation . gold is similarly unaffected by most bases . it does not react with aqueous , solid , or molten	two challenges

What does this ruling suggest specific explanations to the person determines whether a defendant was legally insane be used to weigh ? \n - insanity defense - as " people v . serravo " . in the united kingdom , ireland , and the united states , use of the defense is rare ; however , since the criminal procedure ( insanity and unfitness to plead ) act 1991 , insanity pleas have steadily increased in the uk . mitigating factors , including things not eligible for the insanity defense such as intoxication ( or , more frequently , diminished capacity ) , may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences . the defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction . their testimony guides the jury , but they are not allowed to testify to the accused ' s criminal - - insanity defense - responsibility , as this is a matter for the jury to decide . similarly , mental health practitioners are restrained from making a judgment on the issue of whether the defendant is or is not insane or what is known as the " ultimate issue " . some jurisdictions require the evaluation to address the defendant ' s ability to control their behavior at the time of the offense ( the volitional limb ) . a defendant claiming the defense is pleading " not guilty by reason of insanity " ( ngri ) or " guilty but insane or mentally ill " in some jurisdictions which , if successful , may result in the defendant being committed to a - - insanity defense - psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period . the united states supreme court ( in " penry v . lynaugh " ) and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit ( in " bigby v . dretke " ) have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant ' s mental health violate the defendant ' s eighth amendment rights , saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions . this ruling suggests specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors . diminished responsibility or diminished capacity can be employed as - - insanity - submit their evaluations to the court . since the question of sanity or insanity is a legal question and not a medical one , the judge and or jury will make the final decision regarding the defendant ' s status regarding an insanity defense . in most jurisdictions within the united states , if the insanity plea is accepted , the defendant is committed to a psychiatric institution for at least 60 days for further evaluation , and then reevaluated at least yearly after that . insanity is generally no defense in a civil lawsuit . however , in civil cases , the insanity of the " plaintiff " can toll the statute of - - insanity defense - psychiatrists / psychologists and legal professionals . in the united states , a psychiatrist , psychologist or other mental health professional is often consulted as an expert witness in insanity cases , but the ultimate " legal " judgment of the defendant ' s sanity is determined by a jury , not by a psychologist . in other words , psychologists provide testimony and professional opinion but are not ultimately responsible for answering legal questions . in australia there are nine law units . all may have varying rules ( see ) . in south australia , the criminal law consolidation	mitigating factors
What part of digestion takes place in the location food come from when you throw up ? \n - digestion - enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose , commonly known as table sugar , cane sugar , or beet sugar . sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine . dna and rna are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease ( dnase and rnase ) from the pancreas . some nutrients are complex molecules ( for example vitamin b ) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups . to digest vitamin b non - destructively , haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the b molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are - - digestion - cleaved from their protein complexes . after the b - haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum , pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the b molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor ( if ) . these b - if complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of b - if complexes in the blood . there are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals . there are variations across the vertebrates , as for instance in birds . arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered . for instance , more connections to metabolic control - - digestion - 0 . 5 % hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which lowers the ph to the desired ph of 1 - 3 . acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine . the intestinal phase has two parts , the excitatory and the inhibitory . partially digested food fills the duodenum . this triggers intestinal gastrin to be released . enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei , activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering , and inhibits local reflexes . protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes , pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas , break down food - - digestion - the partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi - liquid chyme . in the small intestine , the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile , pancreatic juice and intestinal juice . the intestinal walls are lined with villi , and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine . in the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place . here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed - - digestion - energy , and thus imposes an " overhead charge " on the energy made available from absorbed substances . differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle , behavior , and even physical structures . examples may be seen in humans , who differ considerably from other hominids ( lack of hair , smaller jaws and musculature , different dentition , length of intestines , cooking , etc . ) . the major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine . the large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion . in mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the -	the major part of digestion

What remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the location implantation of the fertilized ovum usually occur under the same conditions ? \n - implantation ( human embryo ) - implantation ( human embryo ) in humans , implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the embryo adheres to the wall of the uterus . at this stage of prenatal development , the conceptus is called a blastocyst . it is by this adhesion that the embryo receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow . in humans , implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur around 9 days after ovulation , however this can range between 6 and 12 days . the reception - ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the " implantation window " and lasts about 4 days . - - implantation ( human embryo ) - blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus . scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage , which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium . the implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus , both structurally and in the composition of its secretions . to enable implantation , the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus . the endometrium increases thickness , becomes vascularized and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted - - implantation ( human embryo ) - of approximately 5 to 7 days , which corresponds well with the time of implantation . they only persist for 2 to 3 days . the development of them is enhanced by progesterone but inhibited by estrogens . pinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it . by doing so , the volume of the uterus decreases , taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it . thus , the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window . pinopodes continue to absorb fluid , and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation . not only the lining of the uterus transforms , but in addition , - - implantation ( human embryo ) - by synthesis of matrix substances , adhesion molecules and surface receptors for the matrix substances . implantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall . to be able to perform implantation , the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its zona pellucida . this process can be called " hatching " . lytic factors in the uterine cavity , as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process . mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions . a substance probably involved is - - embryonic diapause - embryonic diapause delayed implantation or embryonic diapause is a reproductive strategy used by approximately 100 different mammals in seven or eight different orders . in embryonic diapause , the embryo ( blastocyst ) does not immediately implant in the uterus after sexual reproduction has created the zygote , but is maintained in a state of dormancy . little to no development takes place while the embryo remains unattached to the uterine wall . as a result , the normal gestation period is extended for a species - specific time . while much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized , little is still known about entry into - - implantation	the zona pellucida

People with regular exposure to the of the animal that is a carrier of h1n1 are at increased risk of what ? \n - influenza a virus subtype h1n1 - can also become infected with the h4n6 and h9n2 subtypes . swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide . transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza , often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood . if transmission does cause human influenza , it is called zoonotic swine flu or a variant virus . people with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection . the meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked . pigs experimentally infected with the strain of - - influenza a virus subtype h1n1 - helps to move the virus particles through the infected cell and assist in budding from the host cells . some strains of h1n1 are endemic in humans and cause a small fraction of all influenza - like illness and a small fraction of all seasonal influenza . h1n1 strains caused a small percentage of all human flu infections in 2004 – 2005 . other strains of h1n1 are endemic in pigs ( swine influenza ) and in birds ( avian influenza ) . in june 2009 , the world health organization ( who ) declared the new strain of swine - origin h1n1 as a pandemic . this strain is often called swine flu by the public media . - - ferret - influenza , and have been used to study the 2009 h1n1 ( swine flu ) virus . smith , andrews , laidlaw ( 1933 ) inoculated ferrets intra - nasally with human naso - pharyngeal washes , which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mates . the human influenza virus ( influenza type a ) was transmitted from an infected ferret to a junior investigator , from whom it was subsequently re - isolated . male ferrets are called hobs ; female ferrets are jills . a spayed female is a sprite , a neutered male is a gib , and a vasectomised male is known as a hoblet . ferrets under one year old are known as kits . a group - - influenza a virus subtype h5n1 - and stockpiled by a number of countries , including the united states ( in its national stockpile ) , britain , france , canada , and australia , for use in an emergency . research has shown that a highly contagious strain of h5n1 , one that might allow airborne transmission between mammals , can be reached in only a few mutations , raising concerns about a pandemic and bioterrorism . hpai a ( h5n1 ) is considered an avian disease , although there is some evidence of limited human - to - human transmission of the virus . a risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry , but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans has - - influenza a virus subtype h1n1 - to be teratogenic and embryotoxic ( malformations and toxic effects on the embryo ) when given at high doses in animal studies . influenza a virus subtype h1n1 influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus is the subtype of influenza a virus that was the most common cause of human influenza ( flu ) in 2009 , and is associated with the 1918 outbreak known as the spanish flu . it is an orthomyxovirus that contains the glycoproteins haemagglutinin and neuraminidase . for this reason , they are described	swine flu infection
All muscle fibres in a muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon are of what type ? \n - motor unit - motor unit a motor unit is made up of a motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibers innervated by that motor neuron ' s axonal terminals . groups of motor units often work together to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle ; all of the motor units within a muscle are considered a motor pool . the concept was proposed by charles scott sherrington . all muscle fibres in a motor unit are of the same fibre type . when a motor unit is activated , all of its fibres contract . in vertebrates , the force of a muscle contraction is controlled by the number of activated motor - - skeletal muscle - fibres are cylindrical , and have more than one nucleus . they also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs . muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils . the myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments , repeated in units called sarcomeres , which are the basic functional units of the muscle fiber . the sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle , and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction . connective tissue is present in all muscles as fascia . enclosing each muscle is a layer of connective tissue known as the epimysium ; enclosing each fascicle is a layer called the - - axon - of the same axon . axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons . nerve fibers are classed into three types – group a nerve fibers , group b nerve fibers , and group c nerve fibers . groups a and b are myelinated , and group c are unmyelinated . these groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers . another classification groups only the sensory fibers as type i , type ii , type iii , and type iv . an axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron ; the other - - motor neuron - spinal cord to the effectors . types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons , beta motor neurons , and gamma motor neurons . a single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch . as a result , if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed , the twitches can superimpose on one another , either through summation or a tetanic contraction . in summation , the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch . - - motor neuron - pns , which synapses onto the muscle . all vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic , that is , they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine . parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic , whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic , that is , they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline . ( see table ) motor neuron a motor neuron ( or motoneuron ) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex , brainstem or the spinal cord , and whose axon ( fiber ) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs , mainly muscles and glands . there are two types of motor neuron – upper - - motor neuron - and along with the signals , determine	the same fibre type

What is mentioned at the beginning of the name of the first book of the new testament in the bible ? \n - book of revelation - book of revelation the book of revelation , often called the revelation to john , the apocalypse of john , the revelation , or simply revelation , the revelation of jesus christ ( from its opening words ) or the apocalypse ( and often misquoted as revelations ) , is the final book of the new testament , and therefore also the final book of the christian bible . it occupies a central place in christian eschatology . its title is derived from the first word of the text , written in koine greek : " apokalypsis " , meaning " unveiling " or " revelation " ( before title pages and titles , books were commonly known by the incipit , their first words , - - new testament - that luke the evangelist , an associate of st . paul who was probably not an eyewitness to jesus ' ministry , wrote the gospel of luke and acts of the apostles . scholars are also divided on the traditional claim that mark the evangelist , an associate of st . peter who may have been an eyewitness to jesus ' ministry , wrote the gospel of mark . scholars are more divided over the traditional claim that matthew the apostle wrote the gospel of matthew and that john the apostle wrote the gospel of john . opinion , however , is widely divided on this issue and there is no widespread consensus . - - new testament - the gospel of luke and the acts of the apostles were both written by the same author , and are thus referred to as the lucan texts . the most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book ; both were addressed to theophilus , and the preface to the acts of the apostles references " my former book " about the ministry of jesus . furthermore , there are linguistic and theological similarities between the two works , suggesting that they have a common author . the pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the new testament traditionally attributed to paul of tarsus . the anonymous epistle to the - - new testament - letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the apostle paul , the epistle to the laodiceans . the books of the new testament were all or nearly all written by jewish christians — that is , jewish disciples of christ , who lived in the roman empire , and under roman occupation . luke , who wrote the gospel of luke and the book of acts , is frequently thought of as an exception ; scholars are divided as to whether luke was a gentile or a hellenistic jew . a few scholars identify the author of the gospel of mark as probably a gentile , and similarly for - - new testament - were only a few among many other early christian gospels . the existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the gospel of luke . other early christian gospels such as the so - called " jewish - christian gospels " or the gospel of thomas , also offer both a window into the context of early christianity and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the historical jesus . the acts of the apostles is a narrative of the apostles ' ministry and activity after christ ' s death and resurrection , from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the gospel	the existence of such texts

What is done during the last longer the mitotic phase or interphase ? \n - mitosis - interphase nuclei . during mitotic progression , typically after the anaphase onset , the cell may undergo cytokinesis . in animal cells , a cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells . in plant cells , a cell plate forms between the two nuclei . cytokinesis does not always occur ; coenocytic ( a type of multinucleate condition ) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis . the mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle . it alternates with the much longer " interphase " , where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division . interphase is divided into three phases : g ( first gap ) , s - - mitosis - mitosis in cell biology , mitosis ( ) is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei . cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained . in general , mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the s stage of interphase ( during which the dna is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis , which divides the cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( m ) phase of an animal cell - - mitosis - ( synthesis ) , and g ( second gap ) . during all three parts of interphase , the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles . however , chromosomes are replicated only during the s phase . thus , a cell grows ( g ) , continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes ( s ) , grows more and prepares for mitosis ( g ) , and finally divides ( m ) before restarting the cycle . all these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins , cyclin - dependent kinases , and other cell cycle proteins . the phases follow one another in strict order and there are " checkpoints " that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to - - cell cycle - an arrest in g . some cells enter the g phase semi - permanently and are considered post - mitotic , e . g . , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . many cells do not enter g and continue to divide throughout an organism ' s life , e . g . , epithelial cells . cellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to dna damage or degradation that would make a cell ' s progeny nonviable ; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self - destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis . before a cell can enter cell division , it needs to take in nutrients . all of the preparations are done during interphase . interphase is - - cell cycle - cells . in cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( m ) phase , and cytokinesis . during interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its dna . during the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . during the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells	all of the preparations

What is the location de novo synthesis of purine occur ? \n - nucleotide - nature and / or to synthesize an oligonucleotide . in vivo , nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways . the components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism , and from ammonia and carbon dioxide . the liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides . de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways . pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl - phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid , onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked . purines , however , are - - nucleic acid metabolism - are both primarily produced in the liver . they both contain a sugar and a phosphate , but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes . because of this , the two different groups are synthesized in different ways . however , all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide . adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines . in purine synthesis , prpp is turned into inosine monophosphate , or imp . production of imp from prpp requires glutamine , glycine , aspartate , and 6 atp , among other things . imp is then converted to amp ( adenosine - - purine nucleoside phosphorylase - nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . purine nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . pnp metabolizes inosine into hypoxanthine and guanosine into guanine , in each case creating ribose phosphate . note : adenosine is first metabolized to inosine via the enzyme adenosine deaminase . nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme which cleaves a nucleoside by phosphorylating the ribose to produce a nucleobase and ribose 1 phosphate . it is one enzyme of the nucleotide salvage pathways . these pathways allow the cell to produce nucleotide monophosphates when the " de novo " synthesis pathway has been interrupted or is non - existent ( as is the case in the brain ) . often - - de novo synthesis - beginning . " " de novo " pathways of nucleotides do not use free bases : adenine ( abbreviated as a ) , guanine ( g ) , cytosine ( c ) , thymine ( t ) , or uracil ( u ) . the purine ring is built up one atom or a few atoms at a time and attached to ribose throughout the process . pyrimidine ring is synthesized as orotate and attached to ribose phosphate and later converted to common pyrimidine nucleotides . " de novo " dna synthesis is dna replication without the need for precursor template dna . it ' s also referred to as artificial gene synthesis . primase is an rna polymerase , and it can add a primer to an existing - - biosynthesis - organisms . higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps . purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , which is the first key intermediate in purine base biosynthesis . < ref name = " kappock / purine " > < / ref > further enzymatic modification of imp produces the adenosine and guanosine bases of nucleotides . other dna and rna nucleotide bases that are linked to the ribose sugar via a glycosidic bond are thymine , cytosine and uracil ( which	the major organ of de novo synthesis

What is the majority of the mass of an atom found made of ? \n - atomic mass - atomic mass the atomic mass ( " m " ) is the mass of an atom . its unit is the unified atomic mass units ( symbol : u , or da ) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as of the mass of a single carbon - 12 atom , at rest . for atoms , the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass , and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number . when divided by unified atomic mass units or daltons to form a pure numeric ratio , the atomic mass of an atom becomes a dimensionless value - - atom - every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus . the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons . protons and neutrons are called nucleons . more than 99 . 94 % of an atom ' s mass is in the nucleus . the protons have a positive electric charge , the electrons have a negative electric charge , and the neutrons have no electric charge . if the number of protons and electrons are equal , that atom is electrically neutral . if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons , then it has an overall negative - - atomic nucleus - atomic nucleus the atomic nucleus is the small , dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom , discovered in 1911 by ernest rutherford based on the 1909 geiger – marsden gold foil experiment . after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by dmitri ivanenko and werner heisenberg . an atom is composed of a positively - charged nucleus , with a cloud of negatively - charged electrons surrounding it , bound together by electrostatic force . almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus , with a very small contribution - - mass number - number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( " n " ) in a given nucleus : . the mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element ' s symbol . for example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . the full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( " z " ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : - - atom - center of mass , although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point - like and cannot be said to be rotating . spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant ( ħ ) , with electrons , protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ , or " spin - ½ " . in an atom , electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin , while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin . the magnetic field produced by an atom — its magnetic moment — is determined by these various forms of	one or more protons and typically

What is the process results in an exchange of genes between homologous an important mechanism for ? \n - gene flow - gene flow in population genetics , gene flow ( also known as gene migration or allele flow ) is the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another . if the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . it has been shown that it takes only " one migrant per generation " to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the - - genetics - chromosome would theoretically never recombine . however , they do , via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . during crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of dna , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells . the first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931 . their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other . the probability of chromosomal crossover - - complete linkage - absence of recombination , only parental phenotypes are expected . genetic linkage is the tendency of alleles , which are located closely together on a chromosome , to be inherited together during the process of meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms . during the process of meiosis , homologous chromosomes pair up , and can exchange corresponding sections of dna . as a result , genes that were originally on the same chromosome can finish up on different chromosomes . this process is known as genetic recombination . the rate of recombination of two discrete loci corresponds to their physical proximity . alleles that are closer together have lower rates of recombination than - - gene conversion - alleles in germ cells . recombination occurs not only during meiosis , but also as a mechanism for repair of double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) caused by dna damage . these dsbs are usually repaired using the sister chromatid of the broken duplex and not the homologous chromosome , so they would not result in allelic conversion . recombination also occurs between homologous sequences present at different genomic loci ( paralogous sequences ) which have resulted from previous gene duplications . gene conversion occurring between paralogous sequences ( ectopic gene conversion ) is conjectured to be responsible for concerted evolution of gene families . conversion of one allele to the other is often - - dna - reproduction , when genetic recombination occurs . chromosomal crossover is when two dna helices break , swap a section and then rejoin . recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins . genetic recombination can also be involved in dna repair , particularly in the cell ' s response to double - strand breaks . the most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination , where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences . non - homologous recombination can be damaging to cells , as it can produce chromosomal translocations and - - chromosomal crossover - chromosomal crossover chromosomal crossover (	transferring genetic diversity

" and " utnapistim was not originally part of the tale . " there are five extant gilgamesh stories in the form of older poems in sumerian . these probably circulated independently , rather than being in the form of a unified epic . some of the names of the main characters in these poems differ slightly from later akkadian names ; for example , " bilgamesh " is written instead of " gilgamesh " , and there are some differences - - epic of gilgamesh - discoveries have been published , the epic remains incomplete . analysis of the old babylonian text has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the " epic of gilgamesh " . the most recent akkadian version ( ) , also referred to as the standard version , consisting of twelve tablets , was edited by sin - liqe - unninni and was found in the library of ashurbanipal in nineveh . the " epic of gilgamesh " was discovered by austen henry layard , hormuzd rassam , and	source material

What is the web based the type of information system manages a document through all the stages of its processing becoming ? \n - document management system - lets a user manage access , track and edit information stored . document management software is an electronic cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files . the software helps the businesses to combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned and digital formats gets imported . web based document management software are becoming the staple of the industry . there are many document management software systems available today to manage information in well structured form of data storage and for future archiving such as ineight , archivista , aconex , scenario advantage enterprise content management , - - document management system - damage to a business ' s reputation . the following are important aspects of document control : integrated document management comprises the technologies , tools , and methods used to capture , manage , store , preserve , deliver and dispose of ' documents ' across an enterprise . in this context ' documents ' are any of a myriad of information assets including images , office documents , graphics , and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as web pages , email , instant messages , and video . paper documents have long been used in storing information . however , paper can be costly and , if used excessively , wasteful . document management software is not simply a tool but it - - document automation - arrival acknowledgement forms / reports of many types ( e . g . msds , damaged goods , returned goods , detailed / summary , etc . ) , import / export , delivery , bill of lading ( bol ) , etc . these documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor , so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary , like a third party logistics company ( 3pl ) and governments . document handling within logistics , supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi - automatically using bar code scanners , software and tabletop laser printers . there are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order - - information repository - solutions because of the concurrent deployment of diverse storage technologies running diverse operating systems . they feature centralized management for all deployed data storage resources . they are self - contained , support heterogeneous storage resources , support resource management to add , maintain , recycle , and terminate media , track of off - line media , and operate autonomously . since one of the main reasons for the implementation of an information repository is to reduce the maintenance workload placed on it staff by traditional data storage systems , information repositories are automated . automation is accomplished via policies that can process data based on time , events , data age , and data content . policies manage - - process management ( computing ) - are when one suspends execution while debugging a program , or when the system is monitoring processes . for the five - state process management model , consider the following transitions described in the next sections . each process in the system is represented by a data structure called a process control block ( pcb ) , or process descriptor in linux , which performs the same function as a traveller ' s passport . the pcb contains the basic information	the staple of the industry
What is another method for measuring the initial product of the transcription process abundance ? \n - transcription ( biology ) - the transcription produces messenger rna ( mrna ) ; the mrna , in turn , serves as a template for the protein ' s synthesis through translation . alternatively , the transcribed gene may encode for non - coding rna such as microrna , ribosomal rna ( rrna ) , transfer rna ( trna ) , or enzymatic rna molecules called ribozymes . overall , rna helps synthesize , regulate , and process proteins ; it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ; this single - stranded template is called cdna . the	rt - qpcr

What was the white dress considered by elite brides at the end of the time brides start wearing white wedding dresses ? \n - wedding dress - wedding dress a wedding dress or wedding / bridal gown is the clothing worn by a bride during a wedding ceremony . color , style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants . in western cultures , brides often choose white wedding dress , which was made popular by queen victoria in the 19th century . in eastern cultures , brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness . weddings performed during and immediately following the middle ages were often more than just a union between two people . they could be a union between two families , two businesses or even two - - white wedding - that decorous brides were naturally too timid to show their faces in public until they were married . by the end of the 19th century the white dress was the garment of choice for elite brides on both sides of the atlantic . however , middle - class british and american brides did not adopt the trend fully until after world war ii . with increased prosperity in the 20th century , the tradition also grew to include the practice of wearing the dress only once . as historian vicky howard writes , " [ i ] f a bride wore white in the nineteenth century , it was acceptable and likely that she - - bridesmaid - production of an heir . brides were susceptible to kidnapping at weddings by rival clans and hooligans . shouldering the responsibility to protect the bride , bridesmaids were dressed up like the bride to lower the risk that she might be identified and robbed . as legal protections for marriage were established , this was no longer necessary , and the role of bridesmaid took a more symbolic turn . in the victorian era , white was the official color for both male groomsmen and female bridesmaids . this trend originated with queen victoria when she married prince albert wearing a long white wedding dress , and her bridesmaids matched - - weddings in the united states - parents of the groom . the announcement of the newly married couple took place at their church on the sunday following the wedding . in the 1820s and 1830s , weddings became more elaborate , when upper class couples had wedding ceremonies similar to modern custom . the bride usually wore the best dress she owned , so her dress was not always white , as white dresses were impractical to own . not until the middle of the 19th century did brides start buying a dress made specifically for their wedding day . at the same time , couples began to hire professionals to prepare floral arrangements and wedding - - white wedding - white wedding a white wedding is a traditional formal or semi - formal wedding originating in great britain . the term originates from the white colour of the wedding dress , which first became popular with victorian era elites after queen victoria wore a white lace dress at her wedding . the term now also encapsulates the entire western wedding routine , especially in the christian religious tradition , which generally includes a ceremony during which the marriage begins , followed by a reception . though mary , queen of scots , wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband , francis dauphin of france , the tradition - - white - culture most often associated with beginnings and the new .	the garment of choice

What does " the thing you call the land portion of the earth " refer to ? \n - earth - that the world ' s human population will reach 9 . 2 billion in 2050 . most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations . human population density varies widely around the world , but a majority live in asia . by 2020 , 60 % of the world ' s population is expected to be living in urban , rather than rural , areas . it is estimated that one - eighth of earth ' s surface is suitable for humans to live on – three - quarters of earth ' s surface is covered by oceans , leaving one - quarter as land . half of that land area is desert ( 14 % ) , high mountains ( 27 % ) , or other unsuitable terrains . the northernmost - - earth - . at the other extreme , the slowest - moving plate is the eurasian plate , progressing at a typical rate of . the total surface area of earth is about . of this , 70 . 8 % , or , is below sea level and covered by ocean water . below the ocean ' s surface are much of the continental shelf , mountains , volcanoes , oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus , abyssal plains , and a globe - spanning mid - ocean ridge system . the remaining 29 . 2 % , or , not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains , deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms . tectonics and erosion , volcanic - - land - by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor . the origin of the world ' s oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids , proto - planets , and comets . in this model , atmospheric " greenhouse gases " kept the oceans from freezing while the newly forming sun was only at 70 % luminosity . by , the earth ' s magnetic field was established , which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind . the atmosphere and oceans of the earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface . the crust , which currently forms the earth ' s land , was created when - - land - the molten outer layer of the planet earth cooled to form a solid mass as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere . once land became capable of supporting life , biodiversity evolved over hundreds of million years , expanding continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions . the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present - day forms or , more likely , a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long - term steady continental area . continents formed by plate tectonics , a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the earth ' s interior . on - - land - time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years , the supercontinents have formed and broken apart three times . roughly ( million years ago ) , one of the earliest known supercontinents , rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600 – , then finally pangaea , which also broke apart .

What is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in the primary component of the cytosol ? \n - cytosol - a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space . in eukaryotes , while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol , others take place within organelles . the cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water . although water forms the large majority of the cytosol , its structure and properties within cells is not well understood . the concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid ; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation , cell signaling , and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such - - cytosol - mass of less than 300 da . this mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex , as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism ( the metabolites ) is immense . for example , up to 200 , 000 different small molecules might be made in plants , although not all these will be present in the same species , or in a single cell . estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as " e . coli " and baker ' s yeast predict that under 1 , 000 are made . most of the cytosol is water , which makes up about 70 % of the total volume of a typical cell . the ph - - cytosol - " aqueous cytoplasm " has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells . prior to this , other terms , including " hyaloplasm " , were used for the cell fluid , not always synonymously , as its nature was not very clear ( see protoplasm ) . the proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies : for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria , in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole . the cytosol consists mostly of water , dissolved ions , small molecules , and large water - soluble molecules ( such as proteins ) . the majority of these non - protein molecules have a molecular - - cytosol - out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70 % below normal . although water is vital for life , the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood , mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water , and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale . even the structure of pure water is poorly understood , due to the ability of water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds . the classic view of water in cells is that about 5 % of this water is strongly - - cytoplasm - cytoplasm in cell biology , the cytoplasm is all of the material within a cell , enclosed by the cell membrane , except for the cell nucleus . the material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm . the main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol – a gel - like substance , the organelles – the cell ' s internal sub - structures , and various cytoplasmic inclusions . the cytoplasm is about 80 % water and usually colorless . the submicroscopic ground cell substance , or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm . it is the hyaloplasm of	the cytosol

" he turned to his father eugene levy to help develop the show ; eugene levy came up with series title . daniel levy made the intentional decision to make the location of schitt ' s creek vague for viewers , but in - - schitt ' s creek - opening shot of the first season features lisa vanderpump ’ s former beverly park estate which serves as the facade of the rose family estate . the executive producers are eugene levy , daniel levy , andrew barnsley , ben feigin , fred levy , and daniel white . daniel levy is the showrunner . the series was picked up in the united states by pop and premiered on february 11 , 2015 . season 5 will air on january 16 , 2019 on pop . the show has also been picked up in new zealand by tv2 and tvnz on demand and in australia by the abc and its iview streaming service . the - - schitt ' s creek - august 2018 stated that it is in canada . annie murphy was cast as alexis after abby elliott , who was initially slated for the role , had to drop out . eugene levy suggested catherine o ' hara for the role of moira rose . the series is filmed on location in goodwood , ontario , the regional municipality of durham of the greater toronto area , and mono , ontario , where the motel scenes are filmed . the interior scenes for the first two seasons were filmed at pinewood toronto studios in toronto , while the interior scenes for the third season were shot at dufferin gate studios in toronto . . the - - schitt ' s creek - schitt ' s creek schitt ' s creek ( stylized as schitt creek ) is a canadian television sitcom created by eugene levy and his son daniel levy , that premiered on cbc television on january 13 , 2015 . the series is produced by not a real company productions . on march 6 , 2018 the show was renewed for a 14 - episode fifth season to air on january 8 , 2019 . the series has won various	catherine o ' hara
What provides evidence of the material culture of the thing called ? \n - picts - been adopted from their southern neighbours . the archaeological record provides evidence of the material culture of the picts . it tells of a society not readily distinguishable from its british , gaelic , or anglo - saxon neighbours . although analogy and knowledge of other so - called ' celtic ' societies ( a term they never used for themselves ) may be a useful guide , these extended across a very large area . relying on knowledge of pre - roman gaul , or 13th century ireland , as a guide to the picts of the 6th century may be misleading if analogy is pursued too far . as with most peoples in the north of europe in - - indigenous peoples - and the middle east , then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation , so to speak , and one sees here of what was to take the americas , south east asia , and the pacific by storm a few hundred years later . the idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the medieval period or the enlightenment . the rapid and extensive spread of the various european powers from the early 15th century onwards had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with - - indigenous peoples of the americas - these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods . the clovis culture , the earliest definitively - dated paleo - indians in the americas , appears around 11 , 500 rcbp ( radiocarbon years before present ) , equivalent to 13 , 500 to 13 , 000 calendar years ago . in 2014 , the autosomal dna was sequenced of a 12 , 500 + - year - old infant from montana , whose remains were found in close association with several clovis artifacts . these are the anzick - 1 remains from the anzick clovis burial in montana . the data indicate that the individual was closely related to present north american native american populations . but , the dna was ancestral to present - day south american and central american native - - germanic peoples - norway to north africa . the migrants had varying impacts in different regions . in many cases , the newcomers set themselves up as overlords of the pre - existing population . over time , such groups underwent ethnogenesis , resulting in the creation of new cultural and ethnic identities ( e . g . , the franks and gallo - romans becoming the french ) . thus , many of the descendants of the ancient germanic peoples do not speak germanic languages , as they were to a greater or lesser degree assimilated into the cosmopolitan , literate culture of the roman world . even where the descendants of germanic peoples maintained greater continuity with their common ancestors , significant cultural - - proto - civilisation - led to a fully celtic civilisation , if the areas had not been conquered by the romans and included as the western part of the roman empire . the proto - civilization sites have achieved much and made a big impact on today ' s society . in north america , the mississippian culture is believed to have produced proto - civilizations at such sites as cahokia in illinois , moundville in alabama , and etowah in georgia . proto - civilisation proto - civilisation ( french writing ,	the archaeological record

What is mainly digested in the location trans fats go in the body ? \n - digestion - that move along the stomach wall . this allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes . after some time ( typically 1 – 2 hours in humans , 4 – 6 hours in dogs , 3 – 4 hours in house cats ) , the resulting thick liquid is called chyme . when the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues . when the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood . 95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small - - digestion - proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids . the digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens . for example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin . trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides . digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides . however fats are mainly digested in the small intestine . the presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate - - trans fat - trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted , forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above . the exact biochemical process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research . intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body ' s ability to metabolize essential fatty acids ( efas , including omega - 3 ) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta , the main artery of the heart , thereby raising risk of coronary artery disease . while the mechanisms through which trans fatty acids contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood , the mechanism for their effects on diabetes is - - lipid metabolism - intestinal wall . in the epithelial cells , fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body . digestion is the first step to lipid metabolism , and it is the process of breaking the triglycerides down into smaller monoglyceride units with the help of lipase enzymes . digestion of fats begin in the mouth through chemical digestion by lingual lipase . ingested cholesterol is not broken down by the lipases and stays intact until it enters the epithelium cells of small intestine . lipids then continue to the stomach where chemical digestion continues by gastric lipase and mechanical digestion begins ( peristalsis ) . the majority - - glycogen - store roughly 100 – 120 grams of glycogen . in skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1 – 2 % of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen . the amount of glycogen stored in the body — particularly within the muscles and liver — mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits . small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain . the uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo . approximately 4 - -	fats
What do they transport from large lipids packaged in chylomicrons for absorptions to other locations in the body ? \n - triglyceride - the bond and " releasing " the fatty acid . in triglyceride form , lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum . fatty acids , monoglycerides ( one glycerol , one fatty acid ) , and some diglycerides are absorbed by the duodenum , once the triglycerides have been broken down . in the intestine , following the secretion of lipases and bile , triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis . they are subsequently moved to absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines . the triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons . these are excreted from the - - chylomicron - chylomicron chylomicrons ( from the greek χυλος , chylos , meaning " juice " ( of plants or animals ) , and micron , meaning " small particle " ) are lipoprotein particles that consist of triglycerides ( 85 – 92 % ) , phospholipids ( 6 – 12 % ) , cholesterol ( 1 – 3 % ) , and proteins ( 1 – 2 % ) . they transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body . chylomicrons are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins : chylomicrons ( a . k . a . uldl ultra low - density lipoprotein relative to surrounding water ) , very low - density lipoprotein , intermediate - density lipoprotein , low - density lipoprotein , high - density lipoprotein , that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water - based solution of the bloodstream . chylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to adipose , cardiac , and - - blood lipids - normal blood cholesterol , 200 – 239 mg / dl borderline - high , > 240 mg / dl high cholesterol . the average amount of " blood cholesterol " varies with age , typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old . there appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans , more , on average , in winter . these seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to vitamin c intake . in lipid digestion , cholesterol is packed into chylomicrons in the small intestine , which are delivered to the portal vein and lymph . the chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver hepatocytes via interaction between apolipoproteine and the ldl receptor or lipoprotein receptor - related proteins . cholesterol - - chylomicron - skeletal muscle tissue , where their triglyceride components are hydrolyzed by the activity of the lipoprotein lipase , allowing the released free fatty acids to be absorbed by the tissues . when a large portion of the triacylglycerol core have been hydrolyzed , chylomicron remnants are formed and are taken up by the liver , thereby also transferring dietary fat to the liver . chylomicrons are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells ( enterocytes ) of the small intestine . the villi , lined with the microvilli of the brush border , provide a lot of surface area for absorption . newly formed chylomicrons are secreted through the basolateral - - chylomicron - of fatty acids and monoglycerides . these then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte , where they are re - esterified to form triglycerides . the triglycerides are then combined with phospholipids , cholesteryl esters , and apolipoprotein b - 48 to form a nascent chylomicron . these are then released by exocytosis from the enterocytes	dietary lipids
