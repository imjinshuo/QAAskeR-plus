- heart rate - persons with coronary artery disease . the heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node . it is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves . nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata . the cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves , and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve . during rest , both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart , contributing to autonomic tone . this is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles . normally , vagal stimulation - - heart rate - stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ach ) at the neuromuscular junction . ach slows hr by opening chemical - or ligand - gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization , which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs . without any nervous stimulation , the sa node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm . since resting rates are considerably less than this , it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows hr . this is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal . to speed up , one need merely remove one ’ s foot from -

motor unit a motor unit is made up of a motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibers innervated by that motor neuron ' s axonal terminals . groups of motor units often work together to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle ; all of the motor units within a muscle are considered a motor pool . the concept was proposed by charles scott sherrington . all muscle fibres in a motor unit are of the same fibre type . when a motor unit is activated , all of its fibres contract . in vertebrates , the force of a muscle contraction is controlled by the number of activated motor - - skeletal muscle - fibres are cylindrical , and have more than one nucleus . they also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs . muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils . the myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments , repeated in units called sarcomeres , which are the basic functional units of the muscle fiber . the sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle , and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction . connective tissue is present in all muscles as fascia . enclosing each muscle is a layer of connective tissue known as the epimysium ; enclosing each fascicle is a layer called the - - axon - of the same axon . axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons . nerve fibers are classed into three types – group a nerve fibers , group b nerve fibers , and group c nerve fibers . groups a and b are myelinated , and group c are unmyelinated . these groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers . another classification groups only the sensory fibers as type i , type ii , type iii , and type iv . an axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron ; the other - - motor neuron - spinal cord to the effectors . types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons , beta motor neurons , and gamma motor neurons . a single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch . as a result , if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed , the twitches can superimpose on one another , either through summation or a tetanic contraction . in summation , the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch . -

( see table ) motor neuron a motor neuron ( or motoneuron ) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex , brainstem or the spinal cord , and whose axon ( fiber ) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs , mainly muscles and glands . there are two types of motor neuron – upper -

gene flow in population genetics , gene flow ( also known as gene migration or allele flow ) is the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another . if the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . it has been shown that it takes only " one migrant per generation " to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the - - genetics - chromosome would theoretically never recombine . however , they do , via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . during crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of dna , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells . the first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931 . their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other . the probability of chromosomal crossover - - complete linkage - absence of recombination , only parental phenotypes are expected . genetic linkage is the tendency of alleles , which are located closely together on a chromosome , to be inherited together during the process of meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms . during the process of meiosis , homologous chromosomes pair up , and can exchange corresponding sections of dna . as a result , genes that were originally on the same chromosome can finish up on different chromosomes . this process is known as genetic recombination . the rate of recombination of two discrete loci corresponds to their physical proximity . alleles that are closer together have lower rates of recombination than - - gene conversion - alleles in germ cells . recombination occurs not only during meiosis , but also as a mechanism for repair of double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) caused by dna damage . these dsbs are usually repaired using the sister chromatid of the broken duplex and not the homologous chromosome , so they would not result in allelic conversion . recombination also occurs between homologous sequences present at different genomic loci ( paralogous sequences ) which have resulted from previous gene duplications . gene conversion occurring between paralogous sequences ( ectopic gene conversion ) is conjectured to be responsible for concerted evolution of gene families . conversion of one allele to the other is often - - dna - reproduction , when genetic recombination occurs . chromosomal crossover is when two dna helices break , swap a section and then rejoin . recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins . genetic recombination can also be involved in dna repair , particularly in the cell ' s response to double - strand breaks . the most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination , where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences . non - homologous recombination can be damaging to cells , as it can produce chromosomal translocations and -
