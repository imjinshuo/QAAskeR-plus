What was the town that dreaded sundown based on ? \n - the town that dreaded sundown - some of the earliest in the genre . the film is loosely based on the actual crimes attributed to an unidentified serial killer known as the phantom killer ; it claims that " the incredible story you are about to see is true , where it happened and how it happened ; only the names have been changed . " the actual phantom attacked eight people between february 22 and may 3 , 1946 in or near the town of texarkana , texas , which is on the texas border with arkansas . most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside texarkana , in bowie county , texas , while the film - - the town that dreaded sundown - " star wars " . the advertising department placed the controversial phrase , " in 1946 , this man killed five people . . . today he still lurks the streets of texarkana , ark . " on the poster . after texarkana city officials threatened to sue , pierce tried having the statement removed . the last part of the phrase was censored or removed in advertisements , but it remained on several posters . the film was released theatrically in the united states by american international pictures on december 24 , 1976 , and internationally in sweden ( 1977 ) , west germany ( 1978 ) , and the philippines ( 1979 ) . it was played at drive - ins until the end of 1977 and made its - - sundown town - due to a systematic policy and not change in demographics . african americans were not the only people of color driven out of some towns where they lived . one example , according to loewen , is that in 1870 , chinese people made up one - third of idaho ' s population . following a wave of violence and an 1886 anti - chinese convention in boise , almost none remained by 1910 . in another example , the town of gardnerville , nevada is said to have blown a whistle at 6 p . m . daily alerting native americans to leave by sundown . three additional examples of the numerous road signs documented during the first half - - the town that dreaded sundown - found the bodies . afterwards , he saw the phantom getting into a car and leaving . on the real morning of march 24 , a passing motorist spotted a car and found the bodies of richard griffin and polly ann moore inside before calling the authorities . by the time the officers were on the scene , the killer was long gone . the film states that locals soon started buying guns and locks , but this did not happen until two months later in may . the characters in the film then brought in captain j . d . morales of the texas rangers . truthfully , " lone wolf " did not come - - hermosa , new mexico - hermosa , new mexico hermosa is recognized as a populated place in sierra county , new mexico , united states . it is located in the palomas creek valley west of truth or consequences . it was founded in 1883 by miners and grew to a town that had its own literary society . in 1889 , hermosa was hit by a devastating flash flood and never recovered . all that remains today is a mercantile , a hotel , and a log	a true story
What glands are in the epidermis ? \n - sebaceous gland - first visible from the 13th to the 16th week of fetal development , as bulgings off hair follicles . sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that gives rise to the epidermis of the skin . overexpression of the signalling factors wnt , myc and shh all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence . the sebaceous glands of a human fetus secrete a substance called vernix caseosa , a waxy , translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns . after birth , activity of the glands decreases until there is almost no activity during ages 2 – 6 years , and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty , - - sweat gland - except the lips , ear canal , prepuce , glans penis , labia minora , and clitoris . they are ten times smaller than apocrine sweat glands , do not extend as deeply into the dermis , and excrete directly onto the surface of the skin . the proportion of eccrine glands decreases with age . the clear secretion produced by eccrine sweat glands is termed sweat or " sensible perspiration " . sweat is mostly water , but it does contain some electrolytes , since it is derived from blood plasma . the presence of sodium chloride gives sweat a salty taste . the total volume of sweat produced depends on the number of functional glands - - sebaceous gland - due to heightened levels of androgens . sebaceous glands secrete the oily , waxy substance called " sebum " ( ) that is made of triglycerides , wax esters , squalene , and metabolites of fat - producing cells . sebum waterproofs and lubricates the skin and hair of mammals . sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role . in hot conditions , the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat . this is of importance in delaying dehydration . in colder conditions , the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in - - sebaceous gland - are also known as " tarsal glands " , " zeis glands " and " palpebral glands " . they attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes , which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids . fordyce spots , or fordyce granules , are ectopic sebaceous glands found on the genitals and oral mucosa . they show themselves as yellowish - white milia ( milk spots ) . earwax is partly composed of sebum produced by glands in the ear canal . these secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content , which provides good lubrication . sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris . in the skin pores , sebum - - mammary gland - striking " decapitation " secretion . many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands . some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands . mammary glands develop during different growth cycles . they exist in both sexes during embryonic stage , forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth . in this stage , mammary gland development depends on systemic ( and maternal ) hormones , but is also under the ( local ) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) . this locally secreted factor gives	sebaceous glands
What is known as north korea korea ? \n - names of korea - as a whole , " namhan " ( , ; " south han " ) for south korea , and " bukhan " ( , ; " north han " ) for north korea . south korea less formally refers to north korea as " ibuk " ( , ; " the north " ) . south koreans often refer to korea as " uri nara " ( ) , meaning " our nation " or " our country " . in addition , the official name for the republic of korea in the korean language is " daehan minguk " ( , ; which is usually translated as " the republic of korea " ) . north koreans use " choson " , " namjoson " ( , ; " south choson " ) , and " bukchoson " ( , ; " north choson " ) when referring to korea , south korea , and - - north korea - north korea north korea , officially the democratic people ' s republic of korea ( abbreviated as dprk , prk , dpr korea , or korea dpr ) , is a country in east asia constituting the northern part of the korean peninsula , with pyongyang the capital and the largest city in the country . to the north and northwest , the country is bordered by china and by russia along the amnok ( known as the yalu in chinese ) and tumen rivers ; it is bordered to the south by south korea , with the heavily fortified korean demilitarized zone ( dmz ) separating the two . nevertheless , north korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to - - korea - the communist - inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro - western government in the south , leading to korea ' s division into two political entities : north korea ( formally the democratic people ' s republic of korea ) , and south korea ( formally the republic of korea ) . tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 . with involvement by foreign troops , the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 , but without a formalized peace treaty . this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula . both governments of the two koreas claim to - - names of korea - other theory : the name of either silla or its capital seora - beol was also widely used throughout northeast asia as the ethnonym for the people of silla , appearing [ . . . ] as solgo or solho in the language of the medieval jurchens and their later descendants , the manchus respectively . in vietnam , people call north korea ' ( ; " choson " ) and south korea ' ( ; " hanguk " ) . prior to unification , north vietnam used ' ( ; bukchoson ) and ' ( ; namjoseon ) while south vietnam used ' ( ; bukhan ) and ' ( ; namhan ) for north and south korea , respectively . after unification , the northern vietnamese terminology persisted until the - - names of korea - the north . the korean script is called hangeul ( ) in south korea and " choson ' gul " ( ) in north korea . the korean peninsula is called " hanbando " ( , ) in the south and	the republic of korea
What are made of atoms ? \n - solid - a significant portion of the fields of solid - state chemistry , physics , materials science and engineering . metallic solids are held together by a high density of shared , delocalized electrons , known as " metallic bonding " . in a metal , atoms readily lose their outermost ( " valence " ) electrons , forming positive ions . the free electrons are spread over the entire solid , which is held together firmly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud . the large number of free electrons gives metals their high values of electrical and thermal conductivity . the free electrons also prevent transmission of visible light , making metals opaque , shiny and lustrous . more - - chemical substance - these are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron , copper , and gold . metals typically conduct electricity and heat well , and they are malleable and ductile . around a dozen elements , such as carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , are classified as non - metals . non - metals lack the metallic properties described above , they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions . certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non - metals , and are known as metalloids . a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of molecules or ions . two or more elements - - solid - advanced models of metal properties consider the effect of the positive ions cores on the delocalised electrons . as most metals have crystalline structure , those ions are usually arranged into a periodic lattice . mathematically , the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models , the simplest being the nearly free electron model . minerals are naturally occurring solids formed through various geological processes under high pressures . to be classified as a true mineral , a substance must have a crystal structure with uniform physical properties throughout . minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with - - metal - coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials , for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong , hard - wearing , low - friction plastic gears . other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion , broad - wavelength reflectors , and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility , low friction and corrosion resistance are required . complex metallic alloys ( cmas ) are intermetallic compounds characterized by large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms ; the presence of well - defined clusters of atoms ( frequently with icosahedral symmetry ) ; and partial disorder within their crystalline lattices . they are composed of two or more metallic elements , sometimes with metalloids - - chemical substance - combined into one substance through a chemical reaction form a chemical compound . all compounds are substances , but not all substances are compounds . a chemical compound can be either atoms bonded together in molecules or crystals in which atoms , molecules or ions form a crystalline lattice . compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic compounds , and all others are called inorganic compounds . compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called organometallic compounds . compounds in which components share electrons are known as covalent compounds . compounds consisting of oppositely charged	pure metals
What is a state ? \n - new jersey - new jersey new jersey is a state in the mid - atlantic region of the northeastern united states . it is a peninsula , bordered on the north and east by the state of new york ; on the east , southeast , and south by the atlantic ocean ; on the west by the delaware river and pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the delaware bay and delaware . new jersey is the fourth - smallest state by area but the 11th - most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 , and the most densely populated of the 50 u . s . states ; its biggest city is newark . new jersey lies completely within - - jersey city , new jersey - jersey city , new jersey jersey city is the second - most - populous city in the u . s . state of new jersey , after newark . it is the seat of hudson county as well as the county ' s largest city . as of 2017 , the census bureau ' s population estimates program calculated that jersey city ' s population was 270 , 753 , with the largest population increase of any municipality in new jersey since 2010 , an increase of about 9 . 4 % from the 2010 united states census , when the city ' s population was at 247 , 597 . ranking the city the 75th - most - populous in the nation . part of the new york metropolitan area , jersey city is bounded on - - jersey city , new jersey - the new jersey legislature on january 28 , 1820 , from portions of bergen township , while the area was still a part of bergen county . the city was reincorporated on january 23 , 1829 , and again on february 22 , 1838 , at which time it became completely independent of north bergen and was given its present name . on february 22 , 1840 , it became part of the newly created hudson county . soon after the civil war , the idea arose of uniting all of the towns of hudson county east of the hackensack river into one municipality . a bill was approved by the state legislature on - - new jersey - this bill , the state had no income tax . in the early part of the 2000s , two light rail systems were opened : the hudson – bergen light rail in hudson county and the river line between camden and trenton . the intent of these projects were to encourage transit - oriented development in north jersey and south jersey , respectively . the hblr in particular was credited with a revitalization of hudson county and jersey city in particular . urban revitalization has continued in north jersey in the 21st century . as of 2014 , jersey city ' s census - estimated population was 262 , 146 , with the largest population increase of any municipality in new - - new jersey - base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and middlesex county , and its alumni base is the largest in the state . new jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the new jersey state interscholastic athletic association .

What is enacted common law ? \n - procedures of the supreme court of the united states - of issuing a single opinion of the court was initiated during the tenure of chief justice john marshall during the early 19th century . this custom replaced the previous practice under which each justice , whether in the majority or the minority , issued a separate opinion . the older practice is still followed by appellate courts in many common law jurisdictions outside the united states . supreme court decisions are typically cited as in the following example : " " roe v . wade , " 410 u . s . 113 ( 1973 ) . " the court citation consists of the names of the opposing parties ; the volume number ; " u . s .

What does to magnetic north ? \n - compass - local magnetic meridian , because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the earth ' s magnetic field . the magnetic field exerts a torque on the needle , pulling the north end or " pole " of the needle approximately toward the earth ' s north magnetic pole , and pulling the other toward the earth ' s south magnetic pole . the needle is mounted on a low - friction pivot point , in better compasses a jewel bearing , so it can turn easily . when the compass is held level , the needle turns until , after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out , it settles into its - - magnetic declination - and ( potentially ) any local variations , if the gps is set to use magnetic compass readings . magnetic declination magnetic declination , or magnetic variation , is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north ( the direction the north end of a compass needle points , corresponding to the direction of the earth ' s magnetic field lines ) and true north ( the direction along a meridian towards the geographic north pole ) . this angle varies depending on position on the earth ' s surface and changes over time . somewhat more formally , bowditch defines variation as “ the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place , expressed in degrees - - compass - the lubber line , while formula _ 2 the ferromagnetic effects and formula _ 3 the non - ferromagnetic component . a similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft , with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel . fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically , and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading . a magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole , which is approximately 1 , 000 miles from the true geographic north pole . a magnetic compass ' s user can determine true north by finding - - nautical chart - always true north , rather than magnetic north , towards which a compass points . most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north . however , the use of the mercator projection is not without its drawbacks . mercator ' s technique was to make the lines of longitude parallel . on the real globe , the lines of longitude converge as one goes north or south away from the equator , until they meet at the pole . this distortion means that horizontal distances are exaggerated . mercator ' s solution , imperfect as it might be , was to increase the distance between lines of latitude in proportion ; in - - compass - the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation . variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true ( geographic ) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles . variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914 . deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents ; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself . mariners have long known	a compass point

What is a fruit ? \n - bija - the modification or ' perfuming ' of the subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action . in the course of time this modification matures and issues in a particular result , in the same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately , but only after the ' modifications ' of the shoot , stem , leaf , and flower . the sautrantika school held such a theory as did the mahasamghikas and the early mahasisakas . the sautrantika sthavira srilata held a conception of " subsidiary element " ( " anudhatu " or * " purvanudhatu " ) which also corresponds to this theory of seeds . the seed theory was defended by the buddhist philosopher vasubandhu in - - banyan - banyan a banyan , also spelled " banian " , is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte , i . e . a plant that grows on another plant , when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a host tree or edifice . " banyan " often specifically denominates " ficus benghalensis " ( the " indian banyan " ) , which is the national tree of the republic of india , though the name has also been generalized to denominate all figs that share a common life cycle and used systematically in taxonomy to denominate the subgenus urostigma . like other fig species , including the common edible fig " ficus carica " , banyans bear multiple fruit - - banyan - became generalized to all strangler figs of the " urostigma " subgenus . the many banyan species include : due to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching , the banyan is used as a subject specimen in penjing and bonsai . the oldest , living bonsai in taiwan is a 240 - year - old banyan tree housed in tainan . banyan trees figure prominently in several asian and pacific religions and myths , including : banyan a banyan , also spelled " banian " , is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte , i . e . a plant that grows on another plant , when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a - - the great banyan - botanically known as " ficus benghalensis " , and belonging to the family moraceae , the tree is a native of india . the fruit is like a small fig and is eaten by some people . it tastes sweeter than fig . the banyan plant is seen sometimes growing from the little wet dust deposits on buildings because birds carry them around for eating . the fruit is red and when ripe gets softer . the great banyan tree is believed to be at least 250 years old , and has been referenced in many travel books , going back to at least the nineteenth century . early travel writers found - - banpeiyu - known today as a japanese citrus and is ranked as the most popular pomelo cultivar in japan , producing high quality fruits in the hottest regions of the country . nevertheless , it is assumed to be of unknown , possibly malayan origin , and arrived in japan via taiwan where it was introduced in 1920 , and is sometimes referred to as a taiwan pomelo . it also has many other names , which are similar in pronunciation to " pay you " . the tree is large and of vigorous growth , new buds	a bannana
What kind of tree can grow on tree ? \n - avocado - diversity has relied largely on field collection , as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks . this is problematic , as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive , and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars . more recently , an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees . indoors , an avocado tree is usually grown from the pit of an avocado fruit . this is often done by removing the pit from a ripe , unrefrigerated avocado fruit . the pit is then stabbed with three or four - - avocado - large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion . avocado the avocado ( " persea americana " ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating - - avocado - avocado the avocado ( " persea americana " ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable - - podocarpus - " fruit " . common names for various species include " yellowwood " as well as " pine " , as in the plum pine ( " podocarpus elatus " ) or the buddhist pine ( " podocarpus macrophyllus " ) . " podocarpus " are evergreen woody plants . they are generally trees but may also be shrubs . the trees can reach a height of 40 meters at their tallest . some shrubby species have a decumbent growth habit . the primary branches form pseudo - whorls around the trunk . the bark can be scaly or fibrous and peeling with vertical strips . terminal buds are distinctive with bud scales that are often imbricate and can be spreading . the leaves are simple , flattened and - - ficus obliqua - the same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter , thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months . the animals that eat the figs disperse the seeds , which then germinate and grow on other plants ( epiphytes ) or on rocks ( lithophytes ) . as the new plants develop , they send roots to the forest floor . figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts	avocados
