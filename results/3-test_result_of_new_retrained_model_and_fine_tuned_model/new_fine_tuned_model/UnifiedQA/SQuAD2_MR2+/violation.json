", "ground_truth": "conservation of mechanical energy", "source_answer": "conservation of mechanical energy", "article": " (Force) Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.", "declarative_sentence": "These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.", "target_answer": "yes", "new_question": "Do these tandem effects result ultimately in the final effect of adding more and more idea strings to a load since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine?", "new_answer": "no", "rouge_1_p": "1", "rouge_1_r": "1", "index": "5621", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "0.0", "similar_scores": "[0.0]"}]}
