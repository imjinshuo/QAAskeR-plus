Is the location de novo synthesis of purine occur the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides? \n - nucleotide - nature and / or to synthesize an oligonucleotide . in vivo , nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways . the components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism , and from ammonia and carbon dioxide . the liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides . de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways . pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl - phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid , onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked . purines , however , are - - nucleic acid metabolism - are both primarily produced in the liver . they both contain a sugar and a phosphate , but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes . because of this , the two different groups are synthesized in different ways . however , all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide . adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines . in purine synthesis , prpp is turned into inosine monophosphate , or imp . production of imp from prpp requires glutamine , glycine , aspartate , and 6 atp , among other things . imp is then converted to amp ( adenosine - - purine nucleoside phosphorylase - nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . purine nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . pnp metabolizes inosine into hypoxanthine and guanosine into guanine , in each case creating ribose phosphate . note : adenosine is first metabolized to inosine via the enzyme adenosine deaminase . nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme which cleaves a nucleoside by phosphorylating the ribose to produce a nucleobase and ribose 1 phosphate . it is one enzyme of the nucleotide salvage pathways . these pathways allow the cell to produce nucleotide monophosphates when the " de novo " synthesis pathway has been interrupted or is non - existent ( as is the case in the brain ) . often - - de novo synthesis - beginning .

Was the terminology made popular by the person introduced the term in group and out group and colleagues during his work in formulating social identity theory? \n - ingroups and outgroups - ingroups and outgroups in sociology and social psychology , an ingroup is a social group to which a person psychologically identifies as being a member . by contrast , an outgroup is a social group with which an individual does not identify . for example , people may find it psychologically meaningful to view themselves according to their race , culture , gender , age , or religion . it has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena . the terminology was made popular by henri tajfel and colleagues during his work in formulating social identity theory . the significance - - group ( mathematics ) - the standard model of particle physics ; poincare groups , which are also lie groups , can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity ; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry . the concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations , starting with evariste galois in the 1830s . after contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry , the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870 . modern group theory — an active mathematical discipline — studies groups in their own right . to explore groups , mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller , better - understandable pieces , - - group development - of task that the group is engaged in ( the " acting system " , p . 101 ) . below are descriptions of the central elements of some of the most common models of group development ( see smith , 2001 and van de ven & poole , 1996 for a more complete list of theories and models ) . the first systematic study of group development was carried out by kurt lewin , who introduced the term " group dynamics " ( arrow et al . , 2005 ) . his ideas about mutual , cross - level influence and quasi - stationary equilibria , although uncommon in the traditional empirical research on group development , have resurged recently . his early model of individual change , - - outgroup ( cladistics ) - in use from the earliest days of cladistics , the term " outgroup " is thought to have been coined in the early 1970s at the american museum of natural history . prior to the advent of the term , various other terms were used by evolutionary biologists , including " exgroup " , " related group " , and " outside groups " . the chosen outgroup is hypothesized to be less closely related to the ingroup than the ingroup is related to itself . the evolutionary conclusion from these relationships is that the outgroup species has a common ancestor with the ingroup that is older than the common ancestor of the ingroup . choice of - - intergroup relations - dynamics , and conformity among many others . research in this area has been shaped by many notable figures and continues to provide empirical insights into modern social issues such as social inequality and discrimination . while philosophers and thinkers have written about topics related to intergroup relations dating back to aristotle ' s " politics , " the psychological study of group attitudes and behavior began in the late 19th century . one of the earliest scientific publications on group processes is " " , written in 1895 by french doctor and	yes

Are the two equal sides called the legs and the base of an isosceles triangle is called the base of the triangle? \n - isosceles triangle - appear frequently in architecture and design , for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings . the two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle . the other dimensions of the triangle , such as its height , area , and perimeter , can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base . every isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base . the two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute , so the classification of the triangle as acute , right , or obtuse depends - - isosceles triangle - is acute , right or obtuse depends only on the angle at its apex . in euclidean geometry , the base angles cannot be obtuse ( greater than 90° ) or right ( equal to 90° ) because their measures would sum to at least 180° , the total of all angles in any euclidean triangle . since a triangle is obtuse or right if and only if one of its angles is obtuse or right , respectively , an isosceles triangle is obtuse , right or acute if and only if its apex angle is respectively obtuse , right or acute . in edwin abbott ' s book " flatland " , this classification of shapes was used - - isosceles triangle - two equal sides , and for isosceles sets , sets of points every three of which form an isosceles triangle . in an isosceles triangle that has exactly two equal sides , the equal sides are called legs and the third side is called the base . the angle included by the legs is called the " vertex angle " and the angles that have the base as one of their sides are called the " base angles " . the vertex opposite the base is called the apex . in the equilateral triangle case , since all sides are equal , any side can be called the base . whether an isosceles triangle - - isosceles triangle - triangles with sides unequal to the base , and becomes an equality for the equilateral triangle . the area , perimeter , and base can also be related to each other by the equation if the base and perimeter are fixed , then this formula determines the area of the resulting isosceles triangle , which is the maximum possible among all triangles with the same base and perimeter . on the other hand , if the area and perimeter are fixed , this formula can be used to recover the base length , but not uniquely : there are in general two distinct isosceles triangles with given area formula _ 5 and perimeter - - isosceles triangle - tetrakis hexahedron , pentakis dodecahedron , and triakis icosahedron , each have isosceles - triangle faces , as do infinitely many pyramids and bipyramids . for any isosceles triangle , the following six line segments coincide : their common length is the height formula _ 1 of the triangle . if the triangle has equal sides of length formula _ 2 and base of length formula _ 3 , the general triangle formulas for the lengths of these segments all simplify to this formula can also be derived from the pythagorean theorem using the fact that the altitude bisects the base and partitions the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles . the euler line of any	yes

Do these daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the location the ossification of long bones begin? \n - long bone - long bone the long bones are those that are longer than they are wide . they are one of five types of bones : long , short , flat , irregular and sesamoid . long bones , especially the femur and tibia , are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility . they grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis , with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone . the ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage ( " articular cartilage " ) . the longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate . bone growth in - - ossification - long bones and other bones . this requires a hyaline cartilage precursor . there are two centers of ossification for endochondral ossification . the primary center in long bones , bone tissue first appears in the diaphysis ( middle of shaft ) . chondrocytes multiply and form trebeculae . cartilage is progressively eroded and replaced by hardened bone , extending towards the epiphysis . a perichondrium layer surrounding the cartilage forms the periosteum , which generates osteogenic cells that then go on to make a collar that encircles the outside of the bone and remodels the medullary cavity on the inside . the nutrient artery enters via the nutrient foramen from a - - ossification center - the epiphyses . ossification center the first step in ossification of the cartilage is that the cartilage cells , at the point where ossification is commencing and which is termed as an ossification center , enlarge and arrange themselves in rows . the matrix in which they are imbedded increases in quantity , so that the cells become further separated from each other . a deposit of calcareous material now takes place in this matrix , between the rows of cells , so that they become separated from each other by longitudinal columns of calcified matrix , presenting a granular and opaque appearance . here and there the matrix between - - epiphyseal plate - epiphyseal closure or growth plate fusion . complete fusion happens between ages 12 – 16 for girls and 14 - 19 for boys . endochondral ossification is responsible for the initial bone development from cartilage in utero and infants and the longitudinal growth of long bones in the epiphyseal plate . the plate ' s chondrocytes are under constant division by mitosis . these daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis . as the older chondrocytes degenerate , osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone . in puberty increasing levels of estrogen , in both females and males , leads to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in - - ossification - distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development ) . the epiphyseal arteries and osteogenic cells invade the epiphysis , depositing osteoblasts and osteoclasts which erode the cartilage and build bone . this occurs at both ends of long bones but only one end of digits and ribs . several hypotheses have been proposed for how bone evolved as a structural element in vertebrates . one hypothesis is that bone developed from tissues that evolved to store minerals . specifically , calcium - based minerals were stored in cartilage and bone was an exaptation development from this calcified cartilage . however , other possibilities include bony tissue - - ossification - small opening in the diaphysis . it	yes

Is it a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penmoon located during a solar eclipse and outside the moon located during a solar eclipse? \n - lunar eclipse - involve interactions between the sun , earth , and the moon , they are very different in their interactions . the moon does not completely darken as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by earth ' s atmosphere into the shadow cone ; if earth had no atmosphere , the moon would be completely dark during the eclipse . the reddish coloration arises because sunlight reaching the moon must pass through a long and dense layer of earth ' s atmosphere , where it is scattered . shorter wavelengths are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and small particles ; thus , the longer wavelengths predominate by - - solar eclipses on the moon - earth ' s shadow missed a portion of the moon while every part of the nearside sees a partial eclipse , they are very rare . the last century that not all parts of the nearside and the surrounding parts of the farside saw only as partial was the 18th century . on earth , they are seen as a total penumbral eclipse . it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra . it can happen on the earth ' s northern or southern penumbral edges . these eclipses can last up to about over 4 1 / 2 hours without having any part - - solar eclipse of august 21 , 2017 - clouds , prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra . a partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moon ' s penumbra , including all of north america , particularly areas just south of the totality pass , where the eclipse lasted about 3 – 5 hours , northern south america , western europe , and some of africa and north - east asia . at one location in wyoming , a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse , while the iss was also seen to briefly transit the sun . similar images were captured by nasa from a location in - - solar eclipses on the moon - ends at a different place . all of its solar eclipses begins in the westernmost parts of the nearside and ends in the easternmost parts of the nearside . solar eclipses starting near and within the polar areas has only partial eclipses while solar eclipses starting at or within the equator has only total eclipses . in its eclipses , the penumbral shadow does not appear until it is around 25 – 30 % obscuration , it gets slightly darker when the earth blocks the sunlight until it reaches totality in some eclipses . in some eclipses , its penumbral shadow covers the whole surface whereas the center of the - - january 2018 lunar eclipse - 1866 . the next occurrence will be on january 31 , 2037 , one metonic cycle ( 19 years ) later . a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes within earth ' s umbra ( shadow ) . as the eclipse begins , earth ' s shadow first darkens the moon slightly . then , the shadow begins to " cover " part of the moon , turning it a dark red - brown color ( typically – the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions ) . the moon appears to be reddish because of rayleigh scattering ( the same effect that causes sunsets	yes

Be the mammalian sperm cell can divided in 2 parts: the neck or - - sperm - of animals are produced through spermatogenesis inside the male gonads (sperm made in the human body) via meiotic division? \n - sperm - starting as a totipotent zygote . the human sperm cell is haploid , so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell . in mammals , sperm develops in the testicles , is stored in the epididymis , and released from the penis . the main sperm function is to reach the ovum and fuse with it to deliver two sub - cellular structures : ( i ) the male pronucleus that contains the genetic material and ( ii ) the centrioles that are structures that help organize the microtubule cytoskeleton . the mammalian sperm cell can be divided in 2 parts : the neck or - - sperm - of animals are produced through spermatogenesis inside the male gonads ( testicles ) via meiotic division . the initial spermatozoon process takes around 70 days to complete . the spermatid stage is where the sperm develops the familiar tail . the next stage where it becomes fully mature takes around 60 days when it is called a spermatozoan . sperm cells are carried out of the male body in a fluid known as semen . human sperm cells can survive within the female reproductive tract for more than 5 days post coitus . semen is produced in the seminal vesicles , prostate gland and urethral glands . in 2016 scientists - - spermatogenesis - takes place under the influence of testosterone , which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles . the excess cytoplasm , known as " residual bodies " , is phagocytosed by surrounding sertoli cells in the testes . the resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility , rendering them sterile . the mature spermatozoa are released from the protective sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called " spermiation " . the non - motile spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis in " testicular fluid " secreted by the sertoli cells with the aid of peristaltic contraction . while in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization . - - human reproduction - a sperm may penetrate and merge with the egg , fertilizing it with the help of certain hydrolytic enzymes present in the acrosome . the fertilization usually occurs in the oviducts , but can happen in the uterus itself . the zygote then becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus , where it begins the processes of embryogenesis and morphogenesis . when the fetus is developed enough to survive outside of the uterus , the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel it through the birth canal , which is the vagina . the ova , which are the female sex cells , are much larger than the spermatozoon - - spermatogenesis - has been found to be essential for spermatogenesis in animals . however , a man with estrogen insensitivity syndrome ( a defective erα ) was found produce sperm with a normal sperm count , albeit abnormally low sperm viability ; whether he was sterile or not is unclear . levels of estrogen that are too high can be detrimental to spermatogenesis due to suppression of gonadotropin secretion and by extension intratesticular testosterone production . prolactin also appears to be important for spermatogenesis . spermatogenesis spermatogenesis is the process by which haploid spermatozoa develop from germ cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis . this process starts with the mitotic - - testicle - their contents during the breeding season , and then being	yes
