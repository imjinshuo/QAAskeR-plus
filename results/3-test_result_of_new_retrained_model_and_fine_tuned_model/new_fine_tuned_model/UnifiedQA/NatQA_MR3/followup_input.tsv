What is an insect ? \n - ant - ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy - - ant - a hive mind , a common misconception about ant colonies . ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small - - ant - the ants ' grasp ) is rare and has been noted in inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of " pogonomyrmex " . birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants . birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that , as yet , is not fully understood . here birds rest on ant nests , or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers ; this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds . anteaters , aardvarks , pangolins , echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of - - ant - fossils ( apparently early miocene ) . termites live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘ white ants ’ , but termites are not ants . they are the sub - order isoptera , and together with cockroaches they form the order blattodea . blattodeans are related to mantids , crickets , and other winged insects that do not undergo full metamorphosis . like ants , termites are eusocial , with sterile workers , but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction . the similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution . velvet ants look like large ants , but are wingless female wasps . ants are found on all continents except antarctica , - - insect - the evolutionary relationship of insects to other animal groups remains unclear . although traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes — possibly on the basis of convergent adaptations to terrestrialisation — evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans . in the pancrustacea theory , insects , together with entognatha , remipedia , and cephalocarida , make up a natural clade labeled miracrustacea . insects form a single clade , closely related to crustaceans and myriapods . other terrestrial arthropods , such as centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , and spiders , are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar , sharing ( as do	an ant
Who was to play in major league baseball ? \n - william edward white - william edward white william edward white ( october 1860 – march 29 , 1937 ) was a 19th - century american baseball player . he played as a substitute in one professional baseball game for the providence grays of the national league , on june 21 , 1879 . work by the society for american baseball research ( sabr ) suggests that he may have been the first african - american to play major league baseball , predating the longer careers of moses fleetwood walker and his brother weldy walker by five years ; and jackie robinson by 68 years . very little is known about white , who replaced the regular first baseman , joe start , after - - history of baseball in the united states - a common misconception that jackie robinson was the first african - american major - league ballplayer ; he was actually only the first after a long gap ( and the first in the modern era ) . moses fleetwood walker and his brother weldy walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor - league rosters in the 1880s , as were other african - americans in baseball . an unknown number of african - americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as indians , or south or central americans , and a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well . in the majors , however , it was not until the signing - - jackie robinson - jackie robinson jack roosevelt robinson ( january 31 , 1919 – october 24 , 1972 ) was an american professional baseball player who became the first african american to play in major league baseball ( mlb ) in the modern era . robinson broke the baseball color line when the brooklyn dodgers started him at first base on april 15 , 1947 . when the dodgers signed robinson , they heralded the end of racial segregation in professional baseball that had relegated black players to the negro leagues since the 1880s . robinson was inducted into the baseball hall of fame in 1962 . robinson had an exceptional 10 - year mlb career . he - - moses fleetwood walker - first wife . although jackie robinson is commonly miscredited with being the first african - american to play major league baseball , walker held the honor among baseball aficionados for decades . in 2007 , researcher pete morris discovered that another ball player , former slave william edward white , actually played a single game for the providence grays five years before walker debuted for the blue stockings . despite these findings , baseball historians still credit walker with being the first in the major leagues to play openly as a black man . on the subject of white , john r . husman wrote : “ he played baseball and lived his life as - - bud fowler - was covered by national media . his grave was unmarked . bud fowler john w .

What do avocados grow on ? \n - avocado - diversity has relied largely on field collection , as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks . this is problematic , as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive , and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars . more recently , an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees . indoors , an avocado tree is usually grown from the pit of an avocado fruit . this is often done by removing the pit from a ripe , unrefrigerated avocado fruit . the pit is then stabbed with three or four - - avocado - large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion . avocado the avocado ( " persea americana " ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating - - avocado - avocado the avocado ( " persea americana " ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable - - podocarpus - " fruit " . common names for various species include " yellowwood " as well as " pine " , as in the plum pine ( " podocarpus elatus " ) or the buddhist pine ( " podocarpus macrophyllus " ) .

What is liquid ? \n - hydroxide - an acid . unlike the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides , it does not dissociate in aqueous solution . instead , it reacts with water molecules acting as a lewis acid , releasing protons . a variety of oxyanions of boron are known , which , in the protonated form , contain hydroxide groups . aluminium hydroxide al ( oh ) is amphoteric and dissolves in alkaline solution . in the bayer process for the production of pure aluminium oxide from bauxite minerals this equilibrium is manipulated by careful control of temperature and alkali concentration . in the first phase , aluminium dissolves in hot alkaline solution as but other hydroxides usually present - - aluminium - the mineral from which it was collected . the word " alum " comes from " alumen " , a latin word meaning " bitter salt " . the word " alumen " stems from the proto - indo - european root " * alu - " meaning " bitter " or " beer " . british chemist humphry davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal , is credited as the person who named the element . in 1808 , he suggested the metal be named " alumium " . this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france , germany , and sweden , who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide , alumina , from which it would be isolated . in 1812 , davy chose " aluminum " , thus - - sodium hydroxide - frosts the glass . sodium hydroxide does not attack iron at room temperatures , since iron does not have amphoteric properties ( i . e . , it only dissolves in acid , not base ) . nevertheless at high temperatures ( e . g . above 500°c ) , iron can react endothermically with sodium hydroxide to form iron ( iii ) oxide , sodium metal , and hydrogen gas . this is due to the lower enthalpy of formation of iron ( iii ) oxide ( - 824 . 2kj / mol ) compared to sodium hydroxide ( - 427kj / mol ) , thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable , although its endothermic nature indicates non - spontaneity . consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings : a few transition metals , however , may react - - aluminum electrolytic capacitor - etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is " anodic oxidized " or " formed " . an electrically insulating oxide layer alo is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath . this oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric . this process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the oxygen for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte . first , a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum ( al ) into aluminum hydroxide , al ( oh ) : this reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures , and is - - aluminium ( i ) - making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable . under cold temperatures ( below 77 k ) , disproportionation is slow enough that the alcl solid can be kept for long periods of time . alcl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous hcl at 1200 k and 0 . 2 mbar to yield gaseous alcl and	aluminum hydroxide
