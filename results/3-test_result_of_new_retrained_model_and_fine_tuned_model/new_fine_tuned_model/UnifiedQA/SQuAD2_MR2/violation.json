Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.", "declarative_sentence": "Informal rule is more costly, formal, or informal imperialism.", "target_answer": "yes", "new_question": "Is informal rule more costly, formal, or informal imperialism?", "new_answer": "no", "rouge_1_p": "1", "rouge_1_r": "1", "index": "928", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "0.0", "similar_scores": "[0.0]"}, {"source_question": "How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?", "ground_truth": "nearly three hundred years", "source_answer": "nearly three hundred years", "article": "(Force) Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.", "declarative_sentence": "It took to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion for nearly three hundred years.", "target_answer": "yes", "new_question": "Did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion for nearly three hundred years?", "new_answer": "no", "rouge_1_p": "1", "rouge_1_r": "1", "index": "1318", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "0.0", "similar_scores": "[0.0]"}, {"source_question": "Funding limitations allowed CSNET to be what ?", "ground_truth": "role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet", "source_answer": "a valuable resource", "article": "(Packet_switching) The Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that began operation in 1981.
