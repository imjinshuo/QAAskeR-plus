What is based on the findings of the study of the methods for protecting biodiversity called ? \n - conservation biology - species , pollution , human population , and overharvesting . the primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction ( such as deforestation , agricultural expansion , urban development ) , and overexploitation ( such as wildlife trade ) . habitat fragmentation also poses challenges , because the global network of protected areas only covers 11 . 5 % of the earth ' s surface . a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale . considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth , the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology . however , human activities need not necessarily cause - - natural resource management - relate to different kinds of " biodiversity organization " . according to gray ( p . 154 ) , the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity , was put forward by the united nations in 1992 , involving different aspects of biological diversity . the " threats " wreaking havoc on biodiversity include ; habitat fragmentation , putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources ; forest deterioration and deforestation ; the invasion of " alien species " and " climate change " ( p . 2 ) . since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public , the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management . according to cooney , there are material measures - - conservation biology - of an organism ' s natural habitat , such as on reservations or in gene banks , in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat . also , non - interference may be used , which is termed a preservationist method . preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans . in this regard , conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension , as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems . some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans . conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics - - conservation biology - of all species by 2050 , or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years . the current extinction rate is 100 - 100 , 000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years . conservation biology conservation biology is the management of nature and of earth ' s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species , their habitats , and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions . it is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences , and the practice of natural resource management . the conservation ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology . the term conservation biology and - - conservation biology - less than a year . " coral bleaching " is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses , including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity , causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals . decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years . the loss of coral reefs , which are predicted to go extinct in the next century , threatens the balance of global biodiversity , will have huge economic impacts , and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of	the conservation ethic

What is the location de novo synthesis of purine occur ? \n - nucleotide - nature and / or to synthesize an oligonucleotide . in vivo , nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways . the components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism , and from ammonia and carbon dioxide . the liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides . de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways . pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl - phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid , onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked . purines , however , are - - nucleic acid metabolism - are both primarily produced in the liver . they both contain a sugar and a phosphate , but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes . because of this , the two different groups are synthesized in different ways . however , all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide . adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines . in purine synthesis , prpp is turned into inosine monophosphate , or imp . production of imp from prpp requires glutamine , glycine , aspartate , and 6 atp , among other things . imp is then converted to amp ( adenosine - - purine nucleoside phosphorylase - nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . purine nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . pnp metabolizes inosine into hypoxanthine and guanosine into guanine , in each case creating ribose phosphate . note : adenosine is first metabolized to inosine via the enzyme adenosine deaminase . nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme which cleaves a nucleoside by phosphorylating the ribose to produce a nucleobase and ribose 1 phosphate . it is one enzyme of the nucleotide salvage pathways . these pathways allow the cell to produce nucleotide monophosphates when the " de novo " synthesis pathway has been interrupted or is non - existent ( as is the case in the brain ) . often - - de novo synthesis - beginning . " " de novo " pathways of nucleotides do not use free bases : adenine ( abbreviated as a ) , guanine ( g ) , cytosine ( c ) , thymine ( t ) , or uracil ( u ) . the purine ring is built up one atom or a few atoms at a time and attached to ribose throughout the process . pyrimidine ring is synthesized as orotate and attached to ribose phosphate and later converted to common pyrimidine nucleotides . " de novo " dna synthesis is dna replication without the need for precursor template dna . it ' s also referred to as artificial gene synthesis . primase is an rna polymerase , and it can add a primer to an existing - - biosynthesis - organisms . higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps . purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , which is the first key intermediate in purine base biosynthesis . < ref name = " kappock / purine " > < / ref > further enzymatic modification of imp produces the adenosine and guanosine bases of nucleotides . other dna and rna nucleotide bases that are linked to the ribose sugar via a glycosidic bond are thymine , cytosine and uracil ( which	the major organ of de novo synthesis

What is the majority of the mass of an atom found made of ? \n - atomic mass - atomic mass the atomic mass ( " m " ) is the mass of an atom . its unit is the unified atomic mass units ( symbol : u , or da ) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as of the mass of a single carbon - 12 atom , at rest . for atoms , the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass , and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number . when divided by unified atomic mass units or daltons to form a pure numeric ratio , the atomic mass of an atom becomes a dimensionless value - - atom - every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus . the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons . protons and neutrons are called nucleons . more than 99 . 94 % of an atom ' s mass is in the nucleus . the protons have a positive electric charge , the electrons have a negative electric charge , and the neutrons have no electric charge . if the number of protons and electrons are equal , that atom is electrically neutral . if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons , then it has an overall negative - - atomic nucleus - atomic nucleus the atomic nucleus is the small , dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom , discovered in 1911 by ernest rutherford based on the 1909 geiger – marsden gold foil experiment . after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by dmitri ivanenko and werner heisenberg . an atom is composed of a positively - charged nucleus , with a cloud of negatively - charged electrons surrounding it , bound together by electrostatic force . almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus , with a very small contribution - - mass number - number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( " n " ) in a given nucleus : . the mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element ' s symbol . for example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . the full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( " z " ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : - - atom - center of mass , although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point - like and cannot be said to be rotating . spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant ( ħ ) , with electrons , protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ , or " spin - ½ " . in an atom , electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin , while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin . the magnetic field produced by an atom — its magnetic moment — is determined by these various forms of	one or more protons and typically

What occurs in the location stored in the human body ? \n - sperm - starting as a totipotent zygote . the human sperm cell is haploid , so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell . in mammals , sperm develops in the testicles , is stored in the epididymis , and released from the penis . the main sperm function is to reach the ovum and fuse with it to deliver two sub - cellular structures : ( i ) the male pronucleus that contains the genetic material and ( ii ) the centrioles that are structures that help organize the microtubule cytoskeleton . the mammalian sperm cell can be divided in 2 parts : the neck or - - spermatogenesis - takes place under the influence of testosterone , which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles . the excess cytoplasm , known as " residual bodies " , is phagocytosed by surrounding sertoli cells in the testes . the resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility , rendering them sterile . the mature spermatozoa are released from the protective sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called " spermiation " . the non - motile spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis in " testicular fluid " secreted by the sertoli cells with the aid of peristaltic contraction . while in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization . - - spermatogenesis - system . the initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation . the seminiferous tubules of the testes are the starting point for the process , where spermatogonial stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal direction — beginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part , or " lumen " — to produce immature sperm . maturation occurs in the epididymis . the location [ testes / scrotum ] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm , specifically 1° - 8 °c lower than normal body temperature of 37 °c - - testicle - their contents during the breeding season , and then being reabsorbed by the body . before the next breeding season , new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen . the ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates , including the same range of cell types . testicle the testicle or testis is the male reproductive gland in all animals , including humans . it is homologous to the female ovary . the functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens , primarily testosterone . testosterone release is controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone ; whereas sperm production is controlled both by the - - human fertilization - human fertilization human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . the result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . the process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . the most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , " in vitro " fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly	maturation

What type of the type of information system manages a document through all the stages of its processing software is becoming a staple of the industry ? \n - document management system - lets a user manage access , track and edit information stored . document management software is an electronic cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files . the software helps the businesses to combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned and digital formats gets imported . web based document management software are becoming the staple of the industry . there are many document management software systems available today to manage information in well structured form of data storage and for future archiving such as ineight , archivista , aconex , scenario advantage enterprise content management , - - document management system - damage to a business ' s reputation . the following are important aspects of document control : integrated document management comprises the technologies , tools , and methods used to capture , manage , store , preserve , deliver and dispose of ' documents ' across an enterprise . in this context ' documents ' are any of a myriad of information assets including images , office documents , graphics , and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as web pages , email , instant messages , and video . paper documents have long been used in storing information . however , paper can be costly and , if used excessively , wasteful . document management software is not simply a tool but it - - document automation - arrival acknowledgement forms / reports of many types ( e . g . msds , damaged goods , returned goods , detailed / summary , etc . ) , import / export , delivery , bill of lading ( bol ) , etc . these documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor , so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary , like a third party logistics company ( 3pl ) and governments . document handling within logistics , supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi - automatically using bar code scanners , software and tabletop laser printers . there are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order - - information repository - solutions because of the concurrent deployment of diverse storage technologies running diverse operating systems . they feature centralized management for all deployed data storage resources . they are self - contained , support heterogeneous storage resources , support resource management to add , maintain , recycle , and terminate media , track of off - line media , and operate autonomously . since one of the main reasons for the implementation of an information repository is to reduce the maintenance workload placed on it staff by traditional data storage systems , information repositories are automated . automation is accomplished via policies that can process data based on time , events , data age , and data content . policies manage - - process management ( computing ) - are when one suspends execution while debugging a program , or when the system is monitoring processes . for the five - state process management model , consider the following transitions described in the next sections . each process in the system is represented by a data structure called a process control block ( pcb ) , or process descriptor in linux , which performs the same function as a traveller ' s passport . the pcb contains the basic information	web based
What is another method for measuring the initial product of the transcription process abundance ? \n - transcription ( biology ) - the transcription produces messenger rna ( mrna ) ; the mrna , in turn , serves as a template for the protein ' s synthesis through translation . alternatively , the transcribed gene may encode for non - coding rna such as microrna , ribosomal rna ( rrna ) , transfer rna ( trna ) , or enzymatic rna molecules called ribozymes . overall , rna helps synthesize , regulate , and process proteins ; it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ; this single - stranded template is called cdna . the	rt - qpcr

What was the white dress considered by elite brides at the end of the time brides start wearing white wedding dresses ? \n - wedding dress - wedding dress a wedding dress or wedding / bridal gown is the clothing worn by a bride during a wedding ceremony . color , style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants . in western cultures , brides often choose white wedding dress , which was made popular by queen victoria in the 19th century . in eastern cultures , brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness . weddings performed during and immediately following the middle ages were often more than just a union between two people . they could be a union between two families , two businesses or even two - - white wedding - that decorous brides were naturally too timid to show their faces in public until they were married . by the end of the 19th century the white dress was the garment of choice for elite brides on both sides of the atlantic . however , middle - class british and american brides did not adopt the trend fully until after world war ii . with increased prosperity in the 20th century , the tradition also grew to include the practice of wearing the dress only once . as historian vicky howard writes , " [ i ] f a bride wore white in the nineteenth century , it was acceptable and likely that she - - bridesmaid - production of an heir . brides were susceptible to kidnapping at weddings by rival clans and hooligans . shouldering the responsibility to protect the bride , bridesmaids were dressed up like the bride to lower the risk that she might be identified and robbed . as legal protections for marriage were established , this was no longer necessary , and the role of bridesmaid took a more symbolic turn . in the victorian era , white was the official color for both male groomsmen and female bridesmaids . this trend originated with queen victoria when she married prince albert wearing a long white wedding dress , and her bridesmaids matched - - weddings in the united states - parents of the groom . the announcement of the newly married couple took place at their church on the sunday following the wedding . in the 1820s and 1830s , weddings became more elaborate , when upper class couples had wedding ceremonies similar to modern custom . the bride usually wore the best dress she owned , so her dress was not always white , as white dresses were impractical to own . not until the middle of the 19th century did brides start buying a dress made specifically for their wedding day . at the same time , couples began to hire professionals to prepare floral arrangements and wedding - - white wedding - white wedding a white wedding is a traditional formal or semi - formal wedding originating in great britain . the term originates from the white colour of the wedding dress , which first became popular with victorian era elites after queen victoria wore a white lace dress at her wedding . the term now also encapsulates the entire western wedding routine , especially in the christian religious tradition , which generally includes a ceremony during which the marriage begins , followed by a reception . though mary , queen of scots , wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband , francis dauphin of france , the tradition - - white - culture most often associated with beginnings and the new .	the garment of choice
What does " the thing you call the land portion of the earth " refer to ? \n - earth - that the world ' s human population will reach 9 . 2 billion in 2050 . most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations . human population density varies widely around the world , but a majority live in asia . by 2020 , 60 % of the world ' s population is expected to be living in urban , rather than rural , areas . it is estimated that one - eighth of earth ' s surface is suitable for humans to live on – three - quarters of earth ' s surface is covered by oceans , leaving one - quarter as land . half of that land area is desert ( 14 % ) , high mountains ( 27 % ) , or other unsuitable terrains . the northernmost - - earth - . at the other extreme , the slowest - moving plate is the eurasian plate , progressing at a typical rate of . the total surface area of earth is about . of this , 70 . 8 % , or , is below sea level and covered by ocean water . below the ocean ' s surface are much of the continental shelf , mountains , volcanoes , oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus , abyssal plains , and a globe - spanning mid - ocean ridge system . the remaining 29 . 2 % , or , not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains , deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms . tectonics and erosion , volcanic - - land - by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor . the origin of the world ' s oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids , proto - planets , and comets . in this model , atmospheric " greenhouse gases " kept the oceans from freezing while the newly forming sun was only at 70 % luminosity . by , the earth ' s magnetic field was established , which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind . the atmosphere and oceans of the earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface . the crust , which currently forms the earth ' s land , was created when - - land - the molten outer layer of the planet earth cooled to form a solid mass as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere . once land became capable of supporting life , biodiversity evolved over hundreds of million years , expanding continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions . the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present - day forms or , more likely , a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long - term steady continental area . continents formed by plate tectonics , a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the earth ' s interior . on - - land - time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years , the supercontinents have formed and broken apart three times . roughly ( million years ago ) , one of the earliest known supercontinents , rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600 – , then finally pangaea , which also broke apart .

What is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in the primary component of the cytosol ? \n - cytosol - a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space . in eukaryotes , while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol , others take place within organelles . the cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water . although water forms the large majority of the cytosol , its structure and properties within cells is not well understood . the concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid ; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation , cell signaling , and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such - - cytosol - mass of less than 300 da . this mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex , as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism ( the metabolites ) is immense . for example , up to 200 , 000 different small molecules might be made in plants , although not all these will be present in the same species , or in a single cell . estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as " e . coli " and baker ' s yeast predict that under 1 , 000 are made . most of the cytosol is water , which makes up about 70 % of the total volume of a typical cell . the ph - - cytosol - " aqueous cytoplasm " has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells . prior to this , other terms , including " hyaloplasm " , were used for the cell fluid , not always synonymously , as its nature was not very clear ( see protoplasm ) . the proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies : for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria , in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole . the cytosol consists mostly of water , dissolved ions , small molecules , and large water - soluble molecules ( such as proteins ) . the majority of these non - protein molecules have a molecular - - cytosol - out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70 % below normal . although water is vital for life , the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood , mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water , and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale . even the structure of pure water is poorly understood , due to the ability of water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds . the classic view of water in cells is that about 5 % of this water is strongly - - cytoplasm - cytoplasm in cell biology , the cytoplasm is all of the material within a cell , enclosed by the cell membrane , except for the cell nucleus . the material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm . the main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol – a gel - like substance , the organelles – the cell ' s internal sub - structures , and various cytoplasmic inclusions . the cytoplasm is about 80 % water and usually colorless . the submicroscopic ground cell substance , or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm . it is the hyaloplasm of	the cytosol

What remains with the person signs the assignment of deed of trust ? \n - deed of trust ( real estate ) - money to the seller ; the seller executes a grant deed giving the property to the borrower / trustor ; and the borrower / trustor immediately executes a deed of trust giving the property to the trustee to be held in trust for the lender / beneficiary . in reality , an escrow holder is always used so that the transaction does not close until the escrow holder has the funds , grant deed , and deed of trust in their possession . this ensures the transaction can be easily rescinded if one party is unable to complete its part of the deal . deeds of trust differ from mortgages in that deeds of - - deed of trust ( real estate ) - sale " clauses , the courts have uniformly held that by executing a deed of trust with a " power of sale " clause , the owner has authorized the trustee to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure in the event of default . that is , unlike a mortgage , the lender need not sue the borrower in a state court ; instead , the lender / beneficiary merely directs the trustee to mail ( or serve , publish , or record ) certain notices required by law , culminating in a " trustee ' s sale " at which the trustee auctions the property to the highest bidder . the borrower ' s equitable title normally terminates " automatically " by operation of law ( under applicable - - deed of trust ( real estate ) - deed of trust ( real estate ) in real estate in the united states , a deed of trust or trust deed is a deed wherein " equitable " title in real property is transferred to a trustee , which holds it as security for a loan ( debt ) between a borrower and lender . the " legal " title remains with the borrower . the borrower is referred to as the trustor , while the lender is referred to as the beneficiary . transactions involving deeds of trust are normally structured , at least in theory , so that the lender / beneficiary gives the borrower / trustor the money to buy the property ; the borrower / trustor tenders the - - deed of trust ( real estate ) - statutes or case law ) at the trustee ' s sale . the trustee then issues a deed conveying the legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple to the highest bidder . in turn , the successful bidder records the deed and becomes the owner of record . thus , the advantage of deeds of trust is that the lender can recover the value of the collateral for the loan much more quickly , and without the expense and uncertainty of suing the borrower , which is why lenders overwhelmingly prefer such deeds to mortgages . while true mortgages ( limited to judicial foreclosure ) remain available in every state - - deed of trust ( real estate ) - the beneficiary is required by law to promptly direct the trustee to transfer the property back to the trustor by reconveyance , thus releasing the security for the debt . deeds of trust are the most common instrument used in the financing of real estate purchases in alaska , arizona , california , colorado , the district of columbia , idaho , maryland , mississippi , missouri , montana , nebraska , nevada	the " legal " title
How many times has the person has the sole power to call for impeachment been initiated impeachment proceedings ? \n - impeachment in the united states - until a trial is held . that trial , and their removal from office if convicted , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . analogous to a trial before a judge and jury , these proceedings are ( where the legislature is bicameral ) conducted by upper house of the legislature , which at the federal level is the senate . at the federal level , of the constitution grants to the house of representatives " the sole power of impeachment " , and grants to the senate " the sole power to try all impeachments " . in considering articles of impeachment , the house is obligated to base any charges on the constitutional - - impeachment in the united states - impeachment in the united states impeachment in the united states is the process by which the lower house of a legislature brings charges against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed , analogous to the bringing of an indictment by a grand jury . at the federal level , this is at the discretion of the house of representatives . most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which officials have been impeached and subsequently convicted for crimes committed prior to taking office . the impeached official remains in office - - impeachment in the united states - he resigned from office before the full house voted on the articles of impeachment . to date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction . impeachment proceedings may be commenced by a member of the house of representatives on his or her own initiative , either by presenting a list of the charges under oath or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee . the impeachment process may be initiated by non - members . for example , when the judicial conference of the united states suggests a federal judge be impeached , a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from - - impeachment in the united states - standard would effectively mean that the president would serve at the pleasure of the senate . thus the delegates adopted a compromise version allowing impeachment for " treason , bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors " . the precise meaning of the phrase " high crimes and misdemeanors " is somewhat ambiguous ; some scholars , such as kevin gutzman , argue that it can encompass even non - criminal abuses of power . whatever its theoretical scope , however , congress traditionally regards impeachment as a power to use only in extreme cases . the house of representatives has actually " initiated " impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789 . two cases did not come to trial - - impeachment in the united states - standards specified in : " the president , vice president , and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors " .

People born and resident in what country are assigned a child reference number shortly after the time issued a social security number ? \n - social security number - children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . the original purpose of this number was to track individuals ' accounts within the social security program . it has since come to be used as an identifier for individuals within the united states , although rare errors occur where duplicates do exist . as numbers are now assigned by the central issuing office of the ssa , it is unlikely that duplication will ever occur again . a few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional ssa offices and ( originally ) post offices . employee , patient , student , - - social security number - limited to three per calendar year and ten in a lifetime . identity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local social security numbers by the federated states of micronesia , the republic of the marshall islands , and the republic of palau , whose numbers overlap with those of residents of new hampshire and maine . a person can request a new social security number , but only under certain conditions ; for all of these conditions , credible third - party evidence such as a restraining order or police report , is required . the social security number is a nine - digit number in the format " aaa - gg - ssss " . the number - - national insurance number - national insurance number the national insurance number is a number used in the united kingdom in the administration of the national insurance or social security system . it is also used for some purposes in the uk tax system . the number is described by the united kingdom government as a " personal account number " . the number is sometimes referred to as a ni no or nino . people born and resident in the uk are assigned a child reference number shortly after birth when a claim is made for child benefit . at age 15 years 9 months hm revenue and customs ( hmrc ) notifies - - social insurance number - it to be used as a general purpose identification number , such as by a cable company , is strongly discouraged . the canadian military used the sin as a form of unique identifier from the 1960s until the 1980s , when service numbers were reintroduced . military identification , including id cards and identity discs were marked with the sin during this period . social insurance numbers that begin with the number " 9 " are issued to temporary residents who are not canadian citizens or permanent residents ( e . g . , foreign students , individuals on work visas ) . often , these individuals must have an employment authorization in order to work in - - social security number - about the number of children they supported . during the first year of the tax reform act , this anti - fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . the disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non - custodial parents . in 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . today , an ssn is required regardless of the child ' s age to receive an exemption . since then ,	the uk
What is mainly digested in the location trans fats go in the body ? \n - digestion - that move along the stomach wall . this allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes . after some time ( typically 1 – 2 hours in humans , 4 – 6 hours in dogs , 3 – 4 hours in house cats ) , the resulting thick liquid is called chyme . when the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues . when the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood . 95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small - - digestion - proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids . the digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens . for example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin . trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides . digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides . however fats are mainly digested in the small intestine . the presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate - - trans fat - trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted , forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above . the exact biochemical process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research . intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body ' s ability to metabolize essential fatty acids ( efas , including omega - 3 ) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta , the main artery of the heart , thereby raising risk of coronary artery disease . while the mechanisms through which trans fatty acids contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood , the mechanism for their effects on diabetes is - - lipid metabolism - intestinal wall . in the epithelial cells , fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body . digestion is the first step to lipid metabolism , and it is the process of breaking the triglycerides down into smaller monoglyceride units with the help of lipase enzymes . digestion of fats begin in the mouth through chemical digestion by lingual lipase . ingested cholesterol is not broken down by the lipases and stays intact until it enters the epithelium cells of small intestine . lipids then continue to the stomach where chemical digestion continues by gastric lipase and mechanical digestion begins ( peristalsis ) . the majority - - glycogen - store roughly 100 – 120 grams of glycogen . in skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1 – 2 % of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen . the amount of glycogen stored in the body — particularly within the muscles and liver — mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits . small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain . the uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo . approximately 4 - -	fats
What is formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells of large lipids packaged in chylomicrons for absorption ? \n - triglyceride - the bond and " releasing " the fatty acid . in triglyceride form , lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum . fatty acids , monoglycerides ( one glycerol , one fatty acid ) , and some diglycerides are absorbed by the duodenum , once the triglycerides have been broken down . in the intestine , following the secretion of lipases and bile , triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis . they are subsequently moved to absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines . the triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons . these are excreted from the - - chylomicron - chylomicron chylomicrons ( from the greek χυλος , chylos , meaning " juice " ( of plants or animals ) , and micron , meaning " small particle " ) are lipoprotein particles that consist of triglycerides ( 85 – 92 % ) , phospholipids ( 6 – 12 % ) , cholesterol ( 1 – 3 % ) , and proteins ( 1 – 2 % ) . they transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body . chylomicrons are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins : chylomicrons ( a . k . a . uldl ultra low - density lipoprotein relative to surrounding water ) , very low - density lipoprotein , intermediate - density lipoprotein , low - density lipoprotein , high - density lipoprotein , that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water - based solution of the bloodstream . chylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to adipose , cardiac , and - - blood lipids - normal blood cholesterol , 200 – 239 mg / dl borderline - high , > 240 mg / dl high cholesterol . the average amount of " blood cholesterol " varies with age , typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old . there appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans , more , on average , in winter . these seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to vitamin c intake . in lipid digestion , cholesterol is packed into chylomicrons in the small intestine , which are delivered to the portal vein and lymph . the chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver hepatocytes via interaction between apolipoproteine and the ldl receptor or lipoprotein receptor - related proteins . cholesterol - - chylomicron - skeletal muscle tissue , where their triglyceride components are hydrolyzed by the activity of the lipoprotein lipase , allowing the released free fatty acids to be absorbed by the tissues . when a large portion of the triacylglycerol core have been hydrolyzed , chylomicron remnants are formed and are taken up by the liver , thereby also transferring dietary fat to the liver . chylomicrons are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells ( enterocytes ) of the small intestine . the villi , lined with the microvilli of the brush border , provide a lot of surface area for absorption . newly formed chylomicrons are secreted through the basolateral - - chylomicron - of fatty acids and monoglycerides . these then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte , where they are re - esterified to form triglycerides . the triglycerides are then combined with phospholipids , cholesteryl esters , and apolipoprotein b - 48 to form a nascent chylomicron . these are then released by exocytosis from the enterocytes	chylomicrons

What is a narrow path for what to pass within the penmoon located during a solar eclipse and outside the moon located during a solar eclipse ? \n - lunar eclipse - involve interactions between the sun , earth , and the moon , they are very different in their interactions . the moon does not completely darken as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by earth ' s atmosphere into the shadow cone ; if earth had no atmosphere , the moon would be completely dark during the eclipse . the reddish coloration arises because sunlight reaching the moon must pass through a long and dense layer of earth ' s atmosphere , where it is scattered . shorter wavelengths are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and small particles ; thus , the longer wavelengths predominate by - - solar eclipses on the moon - earth ' s shadow missed a portion of the moon while every part of the nearside sees a partial eclipse , they are very rare . the last century that not all parts of the nearside and the surrounding parts of the farside saw only as partial was the 18th century . on earth , they are seen as a total penumbral eclipse . it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra . it can happen on the earth ' s northern or southern penumbral edges . these eclipses can last up to about over 4 1 / 2 hours without having any part - - solar eclipse of august 21 , 2017 - clouds , prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra . a partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moon ' s penumbra , including all of north america , particularly areas just south of the totality pass , where the eclipse lasted about 3 – 5 hours , northern south america , western europe , and some of africa and north - east asia . at one location in wyoming , a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse , while the iss was also seen to briefly transit the sun . similar images were captured by nasa from a location in - - solar eclipses on the moon - ends at a different place . all of its solar eclipses begins in the westernmost parts of the nearside and ends in the easternmost parts of the nearside . solar eclipses starting near and within the polar areas has only partial eclipses while solar eclipses starting at or within the equator has only total eclipses . in its eclipses , the penumbral shadow does not appear until it is around 25 – 30 % obscuration , it gets slightly darker when the earth blocks the sunlight until it reaches totality in some eclipses . in some eclipses , its penumbral shadow covers the whole surface whereas the center of the - - january 2018 lunar eclipse - 1866 . the next occurrence will be on january 31 , 2037 , one metonic cycle ( 19 years ) later . a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes within earth ' s umbra ( shadow ) . as the eclipse begins , earth ' s shadow first darkens the moon slightly . then , the shadow begins to " cover " part of the moon , turning it a dark red - brown color ( typically – the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions ) . the moon appears to be reddish because of rayleigh scattering ( the same effect that causes sunsets	the moon
