- seven deadly sins - whilst giving them the urge to inflict pain upon others . in accordance with the most widely accepted views , only pride weighs down the soul more than envy among the capital sins . just like pride , envy has been associated directly with the devil , for wisdom 2 : 24 states : " the envy of the devil brought death to the world , " . pride ( latin , ) is considered , on almost every list , the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins : the perversion of the faculties that make humans more like god — dignity and holiness . it is also thought to be the source of the other capital - - seven deadly sins - sins . also known as hubris ( from ancient greek ) , or futility , it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness , the putting of one ' s own desires , urges , wants , and whims before the welfare of other people . in even more destructive cases , it is irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better , superior , or more important than others , failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others , and excessive admiration of the personal image or self ( especially forgetting one ' s own lack of divinity , and refusing to acknowledge one ' s own limits , faults , or wrongs as a human being ) . as pride has been labelled the father - - seven deadly sins - level , are the abuses of the most divine faculty . for dante and other thinkers , a human ' s rational faculty makes humans more like god . abusing that faculty with pride or envy weighs down the soul the most . abusing one ' s passions with wrath or a lack of passion as with sloth also weighs down the soul but not as much as the abuse of one ' s rational faculty . finally , abusing one ' s desires to have one ' s", "declarative_sentence": "pride are the names of the 7 deadly sins.", "target_answer": "the names of the 7 deadly sins", "new_question": "What are the names of the 7 deadly sins ?", "new_answer": "pride", "rouge_1_p": "1.0", "rouge_1_r": "0.875", "index": "970", "dataset": "NatQA", "similar_average": "0.24617192", "similar_scores": "[0.32328135, -0.035975177, 0.3293895, 0.36799204]"}, {"source_question": "what age can my daughter join girl scouts?", "ground_truth": "5 -- 7", "source_answer": "12", "article": "- membership levels of the girl scouts of the usa -

grey metallic lustre . like boron , it is less dense ( at 2 . 33 g / cm ) than aluminium , and is hard and brittle . it is a relatively unreactive element . according to rochow , the massive crystalline form ( especially if pure ) is " remarkably inert to all acids , including hydrofluoric " . less pure silicon , and the -

gene flow in population genetics , gene flow ( also known as gene migration or allele flow ) is the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another . if the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . it has been shown that it takes only " one migrant per generation " to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the - - genetics - chromosome would theoretically never recombine . however , they do , via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . during crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of dna , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells . the first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931 . their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other . the probability of chromosomal crossover - - complete linkage - absence of recombination , only parental phenotypes are expected . genetic linkage is the tendency of alleles , which are located closely together on a chromosome , to be inherited together during the process of meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms . during the process of meiosis , homologous chromosomes pair up , and can exchange corresponding sections of dna . as a result , genes that were originally on the same chromosome can finish up on different chromosomes . this process is known as genetic recombination . the rate of recombination of two discrete loci corresponds to their physical proximity . alleles that are closer together have lower rates of recombination than - - gene conversion - alleles in germ cells . recombination occurs not only during meiosis , but also as a mechanism for repair of double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) caused by dna damage . these dsbs are usually repaired using the sister chromatid of the broken duplex and not the homologous chromosome , so they would not result in allelic conversion . recombination also occurs between homologous sequences present at different genomic loci ( paralogous sequences ) which have resulted from previous gene duplications . gene conversion occurring between paralogous sequences ( ectopic gene conversion ) is conjectured to be responsible for concerted evolution of gene families . conversion of one allele to the other is often - - dna - reproduction , when genetic recombination occurs . chromosomal crossover is when two dna helices break , swap a section and then rejoin . recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins . genetic recombination can also be involved in dna repair , particularly in the cell ' s response to double -

it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ;
