- structure of the earth - of the modern value . seismic measurements show that the core is divided into two parts , a " solid " inner core with a radius of ≈1 , 220 km and a liquid outer core extending beyond it to a radius of ≈3 , 400 km . the densities are between 9 , 900 and 12 , 200 kg / m in the outer core and 12 , 600 – 13 , 000 kg / m in the inner core . the inner core was discovered in 1936 by inge lehmann and is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron and some nickel . since this layer is able to transmit shear waves ( transverse seismic waves ) , it must be solid . experimental evidence has - - structure of the earth - the crust , upper mantle , lower mantle , outer core , and inner core . the geologic component layers of earth are at the following depths below the surface : the layering of earth has been inferred indirectly using the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes . the core does not allow shear waves to pass through it , while the speed of travel ( seismic velocity ) is different in other layers . the changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to snell ' s law , like light bending as it passes through a prism . likewise , reflections are caused by a large - - structure of the earth - certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of earth . dynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core , combined with the coriolis effect , gives rise to earth ' s magnetic field . the solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field ( see curie temperature ) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core . the average magnetic field strength in earth ' s outer core is estimated to be 25 gauss ( 2 .", "declarative_sentence": "the average magnetic field strength in earth ' s outer core is estimated to be 25 gauss ( 2 .", "target_answer": "yes", "new_question": "Is the average magnetic field strength in earth' s outer solid part of earth called estimated to be 25 gauss (2?", "new_answer": "yes", "rouge_1_p": "1", "rouge_1_r": "1", "index": "2405", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "1.0", "similar_scores": "[1.0]"}, {"source_question": "who played marilla cuthbert in anne of green gables?", "ground_truth": "Colleen Rose Dewhurst", "source_answer": "colleen dewhurst", "article": "- barbara hamilton ( actress ) -

it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ;
