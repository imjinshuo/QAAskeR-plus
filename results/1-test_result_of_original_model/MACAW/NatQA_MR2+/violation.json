- transmission medium - concrete . sound is , by definition , the vibration of matter , so it requires a physical medium for transmission , as do other kinds of mechanical waves and heat energy . historically , science incorporated various aether theories to explain the transmission medium . however , it is now known that electromagnetic waves do not require a physical transmission medium , and so can travel through the " vacuum " of free space . regions of the insulative vacuum can become conductive for electrical conduction through the presence of free electrons , holes , or ions . a physical medium in data communications is the transmission path over which a signal propagates . many transmission - - wave - molecules collide , they also bounce away from each other ( a restoring force ) . this keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave . electromagnetic waves do not require a medium . instead , they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles , and can therefore travel through a vacuum . these types vary in wavelength , and include radio waves , microwaves , infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation , x -

matter is a continuous substance . two greek philosophers , leucippus ( first half of the 5th century bc ) and democritus of abdera ( lived about 410 bc ) came up with the notion that there were two real entities : atoms , which were small indivisible particles of matter , and the void , which was the empty space in which matter was located . although all the explanations from thales to democritus involve matter , what is more important is the fact that these rival explanations suggest an ongoing process of debate in which alternate theories were put forth and criticized . xenophanes of colophon prefigured paleontology and geology as - - the void ( philosophy ) - knowledge or experience of the void could be said to actually be unknowing , given its inherent ineffability . in western mystical traditions , it was often argued that the transcendent ' ground of being ' could therefore be approached through aphairesis , a form of negation . western philosophers have discussed the existence and nature of void since parmenides suggested it did not exist and used this to argue for the non - existence of change , motion , differentiation , among other things . in response to parmenides , democritus described the universe as only being composed of atoms and void . aristotle , in book iv of " physics " , denied the existence of the -

scientific and greek philosophers such as leucippus and democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids . circa 450 bc empedocles imagined fundamental elements ( fire ( ) , earth ( ) , air ( ) , and water ( ) ) and " forces " of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact . prior to this , heraclitus had claimed that fire or change was - - universe - be earth , water , air and fire . his four - element model became very popular . like pythagoras , plato believed that all things were composed of number , with empedocles ' elements taking the form of the platonic solids . democritus , and later philosophers — most notably leucippus — proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void ( vacuum ) , although aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air , like water , offers resistance to motion . air will immediately rush in to fill a void , and moreover , without resistance , it would do so indefinitely fast . although heraclitus argued for eternal change , his contemporary parmenides made the radical - - pluralism ( philosophy ) - unity of parmenides . in his " physics , " due to the continuum of zeno ' s paradoxes , as well as both logical and empirical considerations for natural science , he presented numerous arguments against the atomism of leucippus and democritus , who posited a basic duality of " void " and " atoms " . the atoms were an infinite variety of " irreducibles " , of all shapes and sizes , which randomly collide and mechanically hook together in the void , thus providing a", "declarative_sentence": "the modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre -
