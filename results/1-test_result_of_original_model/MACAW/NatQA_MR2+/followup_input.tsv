Did history of linux the history of linux begin in 1991 with the commencement of a personal project by finnish student the person given credit for creating the linux kernel back in 1991 to create a new free operating system kernel? \n - linux kernel - nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . , all of the world ' s 500 most powerful supercomputers run linux . the linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by linus torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross - platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other operating systems or kernels . linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the gnu operating system , which was created as a free , non - proprietary operating system , and based on unix as a - - linux kernel - kernel and loadable kernel modules ( lkms ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design . the linux kernel , developed by contributors worldwide , is a prominent example of free and open source software . day - to - day development discussions take place on the linux kernel mailing list ( lkml ) . the linux kernel is released under the gnu general public license version 2 ( gplv2 ) , with some firmware images released under various non - free licenses . in april 1991 , linus torvalds , at the time a 21 - year - old computer science student at the university of helsinki , finland , started working on some simple ideas - - history of linux - cheap and popular intel 386 architecture for personal computers . in the early nineties a commercial unix operating system for intel 386 pcs was too expensive for private users . these factors and the lack of a widely adopted , free kernel provided the impetus for torvalds ' starting his project . he has stated that if either the gnu hurd or 386bsd kernels had been available at the time , he likely would not have written his own . in 1991 , while studying computer science at university of helsinki , linus torvalds began a project that later became the linux kernel . he wrote the program specifically for - - operating system - kernel originated in 1991 , as a project of linus torvalds , while a university student in finland . he posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers , and received support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel . linux is unix - like , but was developed without any unix code , unlike bsd and its variants . because of its open license model , the linux kernel code is available for study and modification , which resulted in its use on a wide range of computing machinery from supercomputers to smart - watches . although estimates suggest that linux is used - - history of linux - begun to offer a free , perpetual worldwide sublicense . history of linux the history of linux began in 1991 with the commencement of a personal project by finnish student linus torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel . since then , the resulting linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history . since the initial release of its source code in 1991 , it has grown from a small number of c files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4 . 15 version in 2018 with more than 23 . 3 million lines of source	yes

Be the modern concept of molecules can traced back towards pre - scientific and greek philosophers such as leucippus and democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of the person thought atoms and the void comprised all of reality? \n - history of science in classical antiquity - matter is a continuous substance . two greek philosophers , leucippus ( first half of the 5th century bc ) and democritus of abdera ( lived about 410 bc ) came up with the notion that there were two real entities : atoms , which were small indivisible particles of matter , and the void , which was the empty space in which matter was located . although all the explanations from thales to democritus involve matter , what is more important is the fact that these rival explanations suggest an ongoing process of debate in which alternate theories were put forth and criticized . xenophanes of colophon prefigured paleontology and geology as - - the void ( philosophy ) - knowledge or experience of the void could be said to actually be unknowing , given its inherent ineffability . in western mystical traditions , it was often argued that the transcendent ' ground of being ' could therefore be approached through aphairesis , a form of negation . western philosophers have discussed the existence and nature of void since parmenides suggested it did not exist and used this to argue for the non - existence of change , motion , differentiation , among other things . in response to parmenides , democritus described the universe as only being composed of atoms and void . aristotle , in book iv of " physics " , denied the existence of the - - history of molecular theory - history of molecular theory in chemistry , the history of molecular theory traces the origins of the concept or idea of the existence of strong chemical bonds between two or more atoms . the modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre - scientific and greek philosophers such as leucippus and democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids . circa 450 bc empedocles imagined fundamental elements ( fire ( ) , earth ( ) , air ( ) , and water ( ) ) and " forces " of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact . prior to this , heraclitus had claimed that fire or change was - - universe - be earth , water , air and fire . his four - element model became very popular . like pythagoras , plato believed that all things were composed of number , with empedocles ' elements taking the form of the platonic solids . democritus , and later philosophers — most notably leucippus — proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void ( vacuum ) , although aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air , like water , offers resistance to motion . air will immediately rush in to fill a void , and moreover , without resistance , it would do so indefinitely fast . although heraclitus argued for eternal change , his contemporary parmenides made the radical - - pluralism ( philosophy ) - unity of parmenides . in his " physics , " due to the continuum of zeno ' s paradoxes , as well as both logical and empirical considerations for natural science , he presented numerous arguments against the atomism of leucippus and democritus , who posited a basic duality of " void " and " atoms " . the atoms were an infinite variety of " irreducibles " , of all shapes and sizes , which randomly collide and mechanically hook together in the void , thus providing a	yes

Is the last longer the mitotic phase or interphase a relatively short period of the cell cycle? \n - mitosis - interphase nuclei . during mitotic progression , typically after the anaphase onset , the cell may undergo cytokinesis . in animal cells , a cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells . in plant cells , a cell plate forms between the two nuclei . cytokinesis does not always occur ; coenocytic ( a type of multinucleate condition ) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis . the mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle . it alternates with the much longer " interphase " , where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division . interphase is divided into three phases : g ( first gap ) , s - - mitosis - mitosis in cell biology , mitosis ( ) is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei . cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained . in general , mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the s stage of interphase ( during which the dna is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis , which divides the cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( m ) phase of an animal cell - - mitosis - ( synthesis ) , and g ( second gap ) . during all three parts of interphase , the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles . however , chromosomes are replicated only during the s phase . thus , a cell grows ( g ) , continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes ( s ) , grows more and prepares for mitosis ( g ) , and finally divides ( m ) before restarting the cycle . all these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins , cyclin - dependent kinases , and other cell cycle proteins . the phases follow one another in strict order and there are " checkpoints " that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to - - cell cycle - an arrest in g . some cells enter the g phase semi - permanently and are considered post - mitotic , e . g . , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . many cells do not enter g and continue to divide throughout an organism ' s life , e . g . , epithelial cells . cellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to dna damage or degradation that would make a cell ' s progeny nonviable ; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self - destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis . before a cell can enter cell division , it needs to take in nutrients . all of the preparations are done during interphase . interphase is - - cell cycle - cells . in cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( m ) phase , and cytokinesis . during interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its dna . during the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . during the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells	yes

Are the thing you call animals live in water (especially freshwater animals) often of special concern to conservationists because of the fragility of their environments? \n - amphibian - the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology . the word " amphibian " is derived from the ancient greek term αμφιβιος ( " amphibios " ) , which means " both kinds of life " , " αμφι " meaning " of both kinds " and " βιος " meaning " life " . the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water , including seals and otters . traditionally , the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest sense ( " sensu lato " ) was divided into three subclasses , two of which are extinct : the actual number of species in each group depends on the - - water - ph values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7 . earth surface waters are filled with life . the earliest life forms appeared in water ; nearly all fish live exclusively in water , and there are many types of marine mammals , such as dolphins and whales . some kinds of animals , such as amphibians , spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land . plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems . plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain . aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive , and - - marine habitats - pelagic habitats are the habitats of the open water column , away from the bottom of the ocean . demersal habitats are the habitats that are near or on the bottom of the ocean . an organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism , as in pelagic fish . similarly , an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism , as in demersal fish . pelagic habitats are intrinsically ephemeral , depending on what ocean currents are doing . the land - based ecosystem depends on topsoil and fresh water , while the marine ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down - - aquatic animal - ( true seals , eared seals , and the walrus ) . the term " aquatic mammal " is also applied to four - footed mammals like the river otter ( " lontra canadensis " ) and beavers ( family castoridae ) , although these are technically amphibious or semiaquatic . amphibians , like frogs ( the order anura ) , while requiring water , are separated into their own environmental classification . the majority of amphibians ( class amphibia ) have an aquatic larval stage , like a tadpole , but then live as terrestrial adults , and may return to the water to mate . certain fish also evolved to breathe air to survive oxygen - deprived water , such as " arapaima " ( family osteoglossidae ) and walking catfish . most mollusks have - - aquatic animal - animals ) . however , the adjective marine is most commonly used for animals that live in saltwater , i . e . in oceans , seas , etc . aquatic animals ( especially freshwater animals ) are often of special concern to conservationists because of the fragility of their environments . aquatic animals are subject to pressure from overfishing , destructive fishing , marine pollution and climate change . in addition to water breathing animals , e . g . , fish , most	yes

Is 94% of an atom' s mass the majority of the mass of an atom found? \n - atomic mass - atomic mass the atomic mass ( " m " ) is the mass of an atom . its unit is the unified atomic mass units ( symbol : u , or da ) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as of the mass of a single carbon - 12 atom , at rest . for atoms , the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass , and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number . when divided by unified atomic mass units or daltons to form a pure numeric ratio , the atomic mass of an atom becomes a dimensionless value - - atom - every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus . the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons . protons and neutrons are called nucleons . more than 99 . 94 % of an atom ' s mass is in the nucleus . the protons have a positive electric charge , the electrons have a negative electric charge , and the neutrons have no electric charge . if the number of protons and electrons are equal , that atom is electrically neutral . if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons , then it has an overall negative - - atomic nucleus - atomic nucleus the atomic nucleus is the small , dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom , discovered in 1911 by ernest rutherford based on the 1909 geiger – marsden gold foil experiment . after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by dmitri ivanenko and werner heisenberg . an atom is composed of a positively - charged nucleus , with a cloud of negatively - charged electrons surrounding it , bound together by electrostatic force . almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus , with a very small contribution - - mass number - number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( " n " ) in a given nucleus : . the mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element ' s symbol . for example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . the full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( " z " ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : - - atom - center of mass , although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point - like and cannot be said to be rotating . spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant ( ħ ) , with electrons , protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ , or " spin - ½ " . in an atom , electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin , while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin . the magnetic field produced by an atom — its magnetic moment — is determined by these various forms of	yes
Do the gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic cell division process that is responsible for the formation of gametes? \n - gametogenesis - gametogenesis gametogenesis is a biological process by which diploid or haploid precursor cells undergo cell division and differentiation to form mature haploid gametes . depending on the biological life cycle of the organism , gametogenesis occurs by meiotic division of diploid gametocytes into various gametes , or by mitosis . for example , plants produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes . the gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis . the existence of a multicellular , haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as alternation of generations . animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called gonads ( testis in males - - gametogenesis - gametogonia , they are no longer the same between males and females . from gametogonia , male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis . however , by convention , the following pattern is common for both : in vitro gametogenesis ( ivg ) is the technique of developing in vitro generated gametes , i . e . , " the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish .
