What is the last longer the mitotic phase or interphase ? \n - mitosis - interphase nuclei . during mitotic progression , typically after the anaphase onset , the cell may undergo cytokinesis . in animal cells , a cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells . in plant cells , a cell plate forms between the two nuclei . cytokinesis does not always occur ; coenocytic ( a type of multinucleate condition ) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis . the mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle . it alternates with the much longer " interphase " , where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division . interphase is divided into three phases : g ( first gap ) , s - - mitosis - mitosis in cell biology , mitosis ( ) is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei . cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained . in general , mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the s stage of interphase ( during which the dna is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis , which divides the cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( m ) phase of an animal cell - - mitosis - ( synthesis ) , and g ( second gap ) . during all three parts of interphase , the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles . however , chromosomes are replicated only during the s phase . thus , a cell grows ( g ) , continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes ( s ) , grows more and prepares for mitosis ( g ) , and finally divides ( m ) before restarting the cycle . all these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins , cyclin - dependent kinases , and other cell cycle proteins . the phases follow one another in strict order and there are " checkpoints " that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to - - cell cycle - an arrest in g . some cells enter the g phase semi - permanently and are considered post - mitotic , e . g . , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . many cells do not enter g and continue to divide throughout an organism ' s life , e . g . , epithelial cells . cellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to dna damage or degradation that would make a cell ' s progeny nonviable ; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self - destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis . before a cell can enter cell division , it needs to take in nutrients . all of the preparations are done during interphase . interphase is - - cell cycle - cells . in cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( m ) phase , and cytokinesis . during interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its dna . during the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . during the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells	period of the cell cycle

What is based on the findings of the study of the methods for protecting biodiversity called ? \n - conservation biology - species , pollution , human population , and overharvesting . the primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction ( such as deforestation , agricultural expansion , urban development ) , and overexploitation ( such as wildlife trade ) . habitat fragmentation also poses challenges , because the global network of protected areas only covers 11 . 5 % of the earth ' s surface . a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale . considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth , the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology . however , human activities need not necessarily cause - - natural resource management - relate to different kinds of " biodiversity organization " . according to gray ( p . 154 ) , the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity , was put forward by the united nations in 1992 , involving different aspects of biological diversity . the " threats " wreaking havoc on biodiversity include ; habitat fragmentation , putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources ; forest deterioration and deforestation ; the invasion of " alien species " and " climate change " ( p . 2 ) . since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public , the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management . according to cooney , there are material measures - - conservation biology - of an organism ' s natural habitat , such as on reservations or in gene banks , in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat . also , non - interference may be used , which is termed a preservationist method . preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans . in this regard , conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension , as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems . some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans . conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics - - conservation biology - of all species by 2050 , or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years . the current extinction rate is 100 - 100 , 000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years . conservation biology conservation biology is the management of nature and of earth ' s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species , their habitats , and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions . it is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences , and the practice of natural resource management . the conservation ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology . the term conservation biology and - - conservation biology - less than a year . " coral bleaching " is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses , including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity , causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals . decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years . the loss of coral reefs , which are predicted to go extinct in the next century , threatens the balance of global biodiversity , will have huge economic impacts , and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of	the conservation ethic

What is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in the primary component of the cytosol ? \n - cytosol - a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space . in eukaryotes , while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol , others take place within organelles . the cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water . although water forms the large majority of the cytosol , its structure and properties within cells is not well understood . the concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid ; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation , cell signaling , and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such - - cytosol - mass of less than 300 da . this mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex , as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism ( the metabolites ) is immense . for example , up to 200 , 000 different small molecules might be made in plants , although not all these will be present in the same species , or in a single cell . estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as " e . coli " and baker ' s yeast predict that under 1 , 000 are made . most of the cytosol is water , which makes up about 70 % of the total volume of a typical cell . the ph - - cytosol - " aqueous cytoplasm " has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells . prior to this , other terms , including " hyaloplasm " , were used for the cell fluid , not always synonymously , as its nature was not very clear ( see protoplasm ) . the proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies : for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria , in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole . the cytosol consists mostly of water , dissolved ions , small molecules , and large water - soluble molecules ( such as proteins ) . the majority of these non - protein molecules have a molecular - - cytosol - out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70 % below normal . although water is vital for life , the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood , mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water , and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale . even the structure of pure water is poorly understood , due to the ability of water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds . the classic view of water in cells is that about 5 % of this water is strongly - - cytoplasm - cytoplasm in cell biology , the cytoplasm is all of the material within a cell , enclosed by the cell membrane , except for the cell nucleus . the material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm . the main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol – a gel - like substance , the organelles – the cell ' s internal sub - structures , and various cytoplasmic inclusions . the cytoplasm is about 80 % water and usually colorless . the submicroscopic ground cell substance , or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm . it is the hyaloplasm of	the cytosol
What part of the frontal lobe is covered by the part of the brain that is front left ? \n - frontal lobe - frontal lobe the frontal lobe is the largest of the four major lobes of the brain in mammals , and is located at the front of each hemisphere ( in front of the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe ) . it is separated from the parietal lobe by a groove between tissues called the central sulcus , and from the temporal lobe by a deeper groove called the lateral sulcus ( sylvian fissure ) . the most anterior rounded part of the frontal lobe ( though not well - defined ) is known as the frontal pole , one of the three poles of the cerebrum . the frontal lobe is covered by - - frontal lobe - also called basal or ventral ) , and medial part . each of these parts consists of a particular gyrus : the gyri are separated by sulci . e . g . , the precentral gyrus is in front of the central sulcus , and behind the precentral sulcus . the superior and middle frontal gyri are divided by the superior frontal sulcus . the middle and inferior frontal gyri are divided by the inferior frontal sulcus . in humans , the frontal lobe reaches full maturity around the late 20s , marking the cognitive maturity associated with adulthood . a small amount of atrophy , however , is normal in the aging person ’ s frontal lobe . fjell , in - - frontal lobe - the frontal cortex . the frontal cortex includes the premotor cortex , and the primary motor cortex – cortical parts of the motor cortex . the front part of the frontal lobe is covered by the prefrontal cortex . there are four principal gyri in the frontal lobe . the precentral gyrus , is directly anterior to the central sulcus , running parallel to it and contains the primary motor cortex , which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts . three horizontally arranged subsections of the frontal gyrus are the superior frontal gyrus , the middle frontal gyrus , and the inferior frontal gyrus . the inferior frontal gyrus is divided - - prefrontal cortex - prefrontal area was restricted to the anterior - most part of the frontal lobe ( approximately corresponding to the frontal pole ) . it has been hypothesized that his choice of the term was based on the prefrontal bone present in most amphibians and reptiles . prefrontal cortex in mammalian brain anatomy , the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) is the cerebral cortex which covers the front part of the frontal lobe . the pfc contains the brodmann areas ba8 , ba9 , ba10 , ba11 , ba12 , ba13 , ba14 , ba24 , ba25 , ba32 , ba44 , ba45 , ba46 , and ba47 . many authors have indicated an integral link between a person ' s will to live , personality , and the - - prefrontal cortex - prefrontal cortex in mammalian brain anatomy , the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) is the cerebral cortex which covers the front part of the frontal lobe . the pfc contains the brodmann areas ba8 , ba9 , ba10 , ba11 , ba12 , ba13 , ba14 , ba24 , ba25 , ba32 , ba44 , ba45 , ba46 , and ba47 . many authors have indicated an integral link between a person ' s will to live , personality , and the functions of the prefrontal cortex . this brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior	the front part of the frontal lobe
