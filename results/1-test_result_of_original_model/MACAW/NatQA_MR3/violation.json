year - old banyan tree housed in tainan . banyan trees figure prominently in several asian and pacific religions and myths , including : banyan a banyan , also spelled " banian " , is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte , i . e . a plant that grows on another plant , when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a - - the great banyan - botanically known as " ficus benghalensis " , and belonging to the family moraceae , the tree is a native of india . the fruit is like a small fig and is eaten by some people . it tastes sweeter than fig . the banyan plant is seen sometimes growing from the little wet dust deposits on buildings because birds carry them around for eating . the fruit is red and when ripe gets softer . the great banyan tree is believed to be at least 250 years old , and has been referenced in many travel books , going back to at least the nineteenth century . early travel writers found - - banpeiyu - known today as a japanese citrus and is ranked as the most popular pomelo cultivar in japan , producing high quality fruits in the hottest regions of the country . nevertheless , it is assumed to be of unknown , possibly malayan origin , and arrived in japan via taiwan where it was introduced in 1920 , and is sometimes referred to as a taiwan pomelo . it also has many other names , which are similar in pronunciation to " pay you " . the tree is large and of vigorous growth , new buds", "declarative_sentence": "a bannana is fruit.", "target_answer": "a bannana", "new_question": "What is fruit ?", "new_answer": "a ripe apple", "rouge_1_p": "1.0", "rouge_1_r": "1.0", "index": "7493", "dataset": "NatQA", "similar_average": "0.50483346", "similar_scores": "[0.50483346]"}, {"source_question": "is aluminum hydroxide a solid liquid or gas?", "ground_truth": "solid", "source_answer": "liquid", "article": "- hydroxide - an acid . unlike the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides , it does not dissociate in aqueous solution . instead , it reacts with water molecules acting as a lewis acid , releasing protons . a variety of oxyanions of boron are known , which , in the protonated form , contain hydroxide groups . aluminium hydroxide al ( oh ) is amphoteric and dissolves in alkaline solution . in the bayer process for the production of pure aluminium oxide from bauxite minerals this equilibrium is manipulated by careful control of temperature and alkali concentration . in the first phase , aluminium dissolves in hot alkaline solution as but other hydroxides usually present - - aluminium - the mineral from which it was collected . the word " alum " comes from " alumen " , a latin word meaning " bitter salt " . the word " alumen " stems from the proto - indo - european root " * alu - " meaning " bitter " or " beer " . british chemist humphry davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal , is credited as the person who named the element . in 1808 , he suggested the metal be named " alumium " . this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france , germany , and sweden , who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide , alumina , from which it would be isolated . in 1812 , davy chose " aluminum " , thus - - sodium hydroxide - frosts the glass . sodium hydroxide does not attack iron at room temperatures , since iron does not have amphoteric properties ( i . e . , it only dissolves in acid , not base ) . nevertheless at high temperatures ( e . g . above 500°c ) , iron can react endothermically with sodium hydroxide to form iron ( iii ) oxide , sodium metal , and hydrogen gas . this is due to the lower enthalpy of formation of iron ( iii ) oxide ( - 824 . 2kj / mol ) compared to sodium hydroxide ( - 427kj / mol ) , thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable , although its endothermic nature indicates non - spontaneity . consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings : a few transition metals , however , may react - - aluminum electrolytic capacitor - etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is " anodic oxidized " or " formed " . an electrically insulating oxide layer alo is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath . this oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric . this process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the oxygen for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte . first , a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum ( al ) into aluminum hydroxide , al ( oh ) : this reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures , and is - - aluminium ( i ) - making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable . under cold temperatures ( below 77 k ) , disproportionation is slow enough that the alcl solid can be kept for long periods of time . alcl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous hcl at 1200 k and 0 . 2 mbar to yield gaseous alcl and", "declarative_sentence": "aluminum hydroxide is liquid.", "target_answer": "aluminum hydroxide", "new_question": "What is liquid ?", "new_answer": "water", "rouge_1_p": "1.0", "rouge_1_r": "1.0", "index": "8803", "dataset": "NatQA", "similar_average": "0.43130553", "similar_scores": "[0.41161847, 0.45099255]"}]}
