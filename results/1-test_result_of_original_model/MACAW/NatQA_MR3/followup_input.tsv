What was the town that dreaded sundown based on ? \n - the town that dreaded sundown - some of the earliest in the genre . the film is loosely based on the actual crimes attributed to an unidentified serial killer known as the phantom killer ; it claims that " the incredible story you are about to see is true , where it happened and how it happened ; only the names have been changed . " the actual phantom attacked eight people between february 22 and may 3 , 1946 in or near the town of texarkana , texas , which is on the texas border with arkansas . most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside texarkana , in bowie county , texas , while the film - - the town that dreaded sundown - " star wars " . the advertising department placed the controversial phrase , " in 1946 , this man killed five people . . . today he still lurks the streets of texarkana , ark . " on the poster . after texarkana city officials threatened to sue , pierce tried having the statement removed . the last part of the phrase was censored or removed in advertisements , but it remained on several posters . the film was released theatrically in the united states by american international pictures on december 24 , 1976 , and internationally in sweden ( 1977 ) , west germany ( 1978 ) , and the philippines ( 1979 ) . it was played at drive - ins until the end of 1977 and made its - - sundown town - due to a systematic policy and not change in demographics . african americans were not the only people of color driven out of some towns where they lived . one example , according to loewen , is that in 1870 , chinese people made up one - third of idaho ' s population . following a wave of violence and an 1886 anti - chinese convention in boise , almost none remained by 1910 . in another example , the town of gardnerville , nevada is said to have blown a whistle at 6 p . m . daily alerting native americans to leave by sundown . three additional examples of the numerous road signs documented during the first half - - the town that dreaded sundown - found the bodies . afterwards , he saw the phantom getting into a car and leaving . on the real morning of march 24 , a passing motorist spotted a car and found the bodies of richard griffin and polly ann moore inside before calling the authorities . by the time the officers were on the scene , the killer was long gone . the film states that locals soon started buying guns and locks , but this did not happen until two months later in may . the characters in the film then brought in captain j . d . morales of the texas rangers . truthfully , " lone wolf " did not come - - hermosa , new mexico - hermosa , new mexico hermosa is recognized as a populated place in sierra county , new mexico , united states . it is located in the palomas creek valley west of truth or consequences . it was founded in 1883 by miners and grew to a town that had its own literary society . in 1889 , hermosa was hit by a devastating flash flood and never recovered . all that remains today is a mercantile , a hotel , and a log	a true story

What glands are in the epidermis ? \n - sebaceous gland - first visible from the 13th to the 16th week of fetal development , as bulgings off hair follicles . sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that gives rise to the epidermis of the skin . overexpression of the signalling factors wnt , myc and shh all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence . the sebaceous glands of a human fetus secrete a substance called vernix caseosa , a waxy , translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns . after birth , activity of the glands decreases until there is almost no activity during ages 2 – 6 years , and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty , - - sweat gland - except the lips , ear canal , prepuce , glans penis , labia minora , and clitoris . they are ten times smaller than apocrine sweat glands , do not extend as deeply into the dermis , and excrete directly onto the surface of the skin . the proportion of eccrine glands decreases with age . the clear secretion produced by eccrine sweat glands is termed sweat or " sensible perspiration " . sweat is mostly water , but it does contain some electrolytes , since it is derived from blood plasma . the presence of sodium chloride gives sweat a salty taste . the total volume of sweat produced depends on the number of functional glands - - sebaceous gland - due to heightened levels of androgens . sebaceous glands secrete the oily , waxy substance called " sebum " ( ) that is made of triglycerides , wax esters , squalene , and metabolites of fat - producing cells . sebum waterproofs and lubricates the skin and hair of mammals . sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role . in hot conditions , the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat . this is of importance in delaying dehydration . in colder conditions , the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in - - sebaceous gland - are also known as " tarsal glands " , " zeis glands " and " palpebral glands " . they attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes , which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids . fordyce spots , or fordyce granules , are ectopic sebaceous glands found on the genitals and oral mucosa . they show themselves as yellowish - white milia ( milk spots ) . earwax is partly composed of sebum produced by glands in the ear canal . these secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content , which provides good lubrication . sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris . in the skin pores , sebum - - mammary gland - striking " decapitation " secretion . many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands . some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands . mammary glands develop during different growth cycles . they exist in both sexes during embryonic stage , forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth . in this stage , mammary gland development depends on systemic ( and maternal ) hormones , but is also under the ( local ) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) . this locally secreted factor gives	sebaceous glands
What is cipro good for ? \n - ciprofloxacin - antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than others such as clindamycin . studies in other animals raise concerns regarding use in pregnancy . no problems were identified , however , in the children of a small number of women who took the medication . it appears to be safe during breastfeeding . it is a second - generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity that usually results in the death of the bacteria . ciprofloxacin was introduced in 1987 . it is on the world health organization ' s list of essential medicines , the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system . it is available as a generic medication - - ciprofloxacin - is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen " streptococcus pneumoniae " . " respiratory quinolones " such as levofloxacin , having greater activity against this pathogen , are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community - acquired pneumonia in patients with important co - morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization ( infectious diseases society of america 2007 ) . similarly , ciprofloxacin is not recommended as a first - line treatment for acute sinusitis . ciprofloxacin is approved for the treatment of gonorrhea in many countries , but this recommendation is widely regarded as obsolete due to resistance development . in the - - ciprofloxacin - and not very expensive . the wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0 . 03 and 0 . 13 a dose . in the united states it is sold for about 0 . 40 per dose . ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections , including infections of bones and joints , endocarditis , gastroenteritis , malignant otitis externa , respiratory tract infections , cellulitis , urinary tract infections , prostatitis , anthrax , and chancroid . ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections ; it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold . for certain uses including acute sinusitis , lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea , ciprofloxacin is not considered a first - line agent . ciprofloxacin occupies - - ciprofloxacin - made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother . oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the fda for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system : 1 ) inhalational anthrax ( postexposure ) 2 ) complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to " escherichia coli " , but never as first - line agents . current recommendations by the american academy of pediatrics note the systemic use of ciprofloxacin in children should be restricted to infections caused by multidrug - resistant pathogens or when no safe or effective alternatives - - ciprofloxacin - are available . its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for community - acquired pneumonias , bronchitis , urinary tract infections , and gastroenteritis . ciprofloxacin is particularly effective against gram - negative bacteria ( such as " escherichia coli " , " haemophilus influenzae " , " klebsiella pneumoniae " , " legionella pneumophila " , " moraxella catarrhalis " , " proteus mirabilis " , and " pseudomonas aeruginosa " ) , but is less effective against gram - positive bacteria ( such as methicillin - sensitive " staphylococcus aureus " , " streptococcus pneumoniae " , and	an upper respiratory infection
What are made of ions ? \n - solid - a significant portion of the fields of solid - state chemistry , physics , materials science and engineering . metallic solids are held together by a high density of shared , delocalized electrons , known as " metallic bonding " . in a metal , atoms readily lose their outermost ( " valence " ) electrons , forming positive ions . the free electrons are spread over the entire solid , which is held together firmly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud . the large number of free electrons gives metals their high values of electrical and thermal conductivity . the free electrons also prevent transmission of visible light , making metals opaque , shiny and lustrous . more - - chemical substance - these are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron , copper , and gold . metals typically conduct electricity and heat well , and they are malleable and ductile . around a dozen elements , such as carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , are classified as non - metals . non - metals lack the metallic properties described above , they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions . certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non - metals , and are known as metalloids . a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of molecules or ions . two or more elements - - solid - advanced models of metal properties consider the effect of the positive ions cores on the delocalised electrons . as most metals have crystalline structure , those ions are usually arranged into a periodic lattice . mathematically , the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models , the simplest being the nearly free electron model . minerals are naturally occurring solids formed through various geological processes under high pressures . to be classified as a true mineral , a substance must have a crystal structure with uniform physical properties throughout . minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with - - metal - coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials , for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong , hard - wearing , low - friction plastic gears . other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion , broad - wavelength reflectors , and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility , low friction and corrosion resistance are required . complex metallic alloys ( cmas ) are intermetallic compounds characterized by large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms ; the presence of well - defined clusters of atoms ( frequently with icosahedral symmetry ) ; and partial disorder within their crystalline lattices . they are composed of two or more metallic elements , sometimes with metalloids - - chemical substance - combined into one substance through a chemical reaction form a chemical compound . all compounds are substances , but not all substances are compounds . a chemical compound can be either atoms bonded together in molecules or crystals in which atoms , molecules or ions form a crystalline lattice . compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic compounds , and all others are called inorganic compounds . compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called organometallic compounds . compounds in which components share electrons are known as covalent compounds . compounds consisting of oppositely charged	pure metals

What is enacted enacted law ? \n - procedures of the supreme court of the united states - of issuing a single opinion of the court was initiated during the tenure of chief justice john marshall during the early 19th century . this custom replaced the previous practice under which each justice , whether in the majority or the minority , issued a separate opinion . the older practice is still followed by appellate courts in many common law jurisdictions outside the united states . supreme court decisions are typically cited as in the following example : " " roe v . wade , " 410 u . s . 113 ( 1973 ) . " the court citation consists of the names of the opposing parties ; the volume number ; " u . s .

What does to magnetic north ? \n - compass - local magnetic meridian , because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the earth ' s magnetic field . the magnetic field exerts a torque on the needle , pulling the north end or " pole " of the needle approximately toward the earth ' s north magnetic pole , and pulling the other toward the earth ' s south magnetic pole . the needle is mounted on a low - friction pivot point , in better compasses a jewel bearing , so it can turn easily . when the compass is held level , the needle turns until , after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out , it settles into its - - magnetic declination - and ( potentially ) any local variations , if the gps is set to use magnetic compass readings . magnetic declination magnetic declination , or magnetic variation , is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north ( the direction the north end of a compass needle points , corresponding to the direction of the earth ' s magnetic field lines ) and true north ( the direction along a meridian towards the geographic north pole ) . this angle varies depending on position on the earth ' s surface and changes over time . somewhat more formally , bowditch defines variation as “ the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place , expressed in degrees - - compass - the lubber line , while formula _ 2 the ferromagnetic effects and formula _ 3 the non - ferromagnetic component . a similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft , with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel . fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically , and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading . a magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole , which is approximately 1 , 000 miles from the true geographic north pole . a magnetic compass ' s user can determine true north by finding - - nautical chart - always true north , rather than magnetic north , towards which a compass points . most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north . however , the use of the mercator projection is not without its drawbacks . mercator ' s technique was to make the lines of longitude parallel . on the real globe , the lines of longitude converge as one goes north or south away from the equator , until they meet at the pole . this distortion means that horizontal distances are exaggerated . mercator ' s solution , imperfect as it might be , was to increase the distance between lines of latitude in proportion ; in - - compass - the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation . variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true ( geographic ) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles . variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914 . deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents ; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself . mariners have long known	a compass point

What is fruit ? \n - bija - the modification or ' perfuming ' of the subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action . in the course of time this modification matures and issues in a particular result , in the same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately , but only after the ' modifications ' of the shoot , stem , leaf , and flower . the sautrantika school held such a theory as did the mahasamghikas and the early mahasisakas . the sautrantika sthavira srilata held a conception of " subsidiary element " ( " anudhatu " or * " purvanudhatu " ) which also corresponds to this theory of seeds . the seed theory was defended by the buddhist philosopher vasubandhu in - - banyan - banyan a banyan , also spelled " banian " , is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte , i . e . a plant that grows on another plant , when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a host tree or edifice . " banyan " often specifically denominates " ficus benghalensis " ( the " indian banyan " ) , which is the national tree of the republic of india , though the name has also been generalized to denominate all figs that share a common life cycle and used systematically in taxonomy to denominate the subgenus urostigma . like other fig species , including the common edible fig " ficus carica " , banyans bear multiple fruit - - banyan - became generalized to all strangler figs of the " urostigma " subgenus . the many banyan species include : due to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching , the banyan is used as a subject specimen in penjing and bonsai . the oldest , living bonsai in taiwan is a 240 - year - old banyan tree housed in tainan . banyan trees figure prominently in several asian and pacific religions and myths , including : banyan a banyan , also spelled " banian " , is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte , i . e . a plant that grows on another plant , when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a - - the great banyan - botanically known as " ficus benghalensis " , and belonging to the family moraceae , the tree is a native of india . the fruit is like a small fig and is eaten by some people . it tastes sweeter than fig . the banyan plant is seen sometimes growing from the little wet dust deposits on buildings because birds carry them around for eating . the fruit is red and when ripe gets softer . the great banyan tree is believed to be at least 250 years old , and has been referenced in many travel books , going back to at least the nineteenth century . early travel writers found - - banpeiyu - known today as a japanese citrus and is ranked as the most popular pomelo cultivar in japan , producing high quality fruits in the hottest regions of the country . nevertheless , it is assumed to be of unknown , possibly malayan origin , and arrived in japan via taiwan where it was introduced in 1920 , and is sometimes referred to as a taiwan pomelo . it also has many other names , which are similar in pronunciation to " pay you " . the tree is large and of vigorous growth , new buds	a bannana

What is liquid ? \n - hydroxide - an acid . unlike the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides , it does not dissociate in aqueous solution . instead , it reacts with water molecules acting as a lewis acid , releasing protons . a variety of oxyanions of boron are known , which , in the protonated form , contain hydroxide groups . aluminium hydroxide al ( oh ) is amphoteric and dissolves in alkaline solution . in the bayer process for the production of pure aluminium oxide from bauxite minerals this equilibrium is manipulated by careful control of temperature and alkali concentration . in the first phase , aluminium dissolves in hot alkaline solution as but other hydroxides usually present - - aluminium - the mineral from which it was collected . the word " alum " comes from " alumen " , a latin word meaning " bitter salt " . the word " alumen " stems from the proto - indo - european root " * alu - " meaning " bitter " or " beer " . british chemist humphry davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal , is credited as the person who named the element . in 1808 , he suggested the metal be named " alumium " . this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france , germany , and sweden , who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide , alumina , from which it would be isolated . in 1812 , davy chose " aluminum " , thus - - sodium hydroxide - frosts the glass . sodium hydroxide does not attack iron at room temperatures , since iron does not have amphoteric properties ( i . e . , it only dissolves in acid , not base ) . nevertheless at high temperatures ( e . g . above 500°c ) , iron can react endothermically with sodium hydroxide to form iron ( iii ) oxide , sodium metal , and hydrogen gas . this is due to the lower enthalpy of formation of iron ( iii ) oxide ( - 824 . 2kj / mol ) compared to sodium hydroxide ( - 427kj / mol ) , thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable , although its endothermic nature indicates non - spontaneity . consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings : a few transition metals , however , may react - - aluminum electrolytic capacitor - etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is " anodic oxidized " or " formed " . an electrically insulating oxide layer alo is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath . this oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric . this process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the oxygen for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte . first , a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum ( al ) into aluminum hydroxide , al ( oh ) : this reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures , and is - - aluminium ( i ) - making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable . under cold temperatures ( below 77 k ) , disproportionation is slow enough that the alcl solid can be kept for long periods of time . alcl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous hcl at 1200 k and 0 . 2 mbar to yield gaseous alcl and	aluminum hydroxide
