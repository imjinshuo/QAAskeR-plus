" the actual phantom attacked eight people between february 22 and may 3 , 1946 in or near the town of texarkana , texas , which is on the texas border with arkansas . most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside texarkana , in bowie county , texas , while the film - - the town that dreaded sundown - " star wars " . the advertising department placed the controversial phrase , " in 1946 , this man killed five people . . . today he still lurks the streets of texarkana , ark .
