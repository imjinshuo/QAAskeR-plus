What is generated by the group of cells that control the natural resting heart rate found ? \n - heart rate - at rest . bradycardia is a slow heart rate , defined as below 60 bpm at rest . during sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40 – 50 bpm is common and is considered normal . when the heart is not beating in a regular pattern , this is referred to as an arrhythmia . abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease . while heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions , heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node . the accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing norepinephrine onto the cells of the sinoatrial node - - cardiac pacemaker - and eventual action potential in contractile cells . having cardiomyocytes connected via gap junctions allow all contractile cells of the heart to act in a coordinated fashion and contract as a unit . all the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells ; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes . cells in the sa node spontaneously depolarize , ultimately resulting in contraction , approximately 100 times per minute . this native rate is constantly modified by the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers via the autonomic nervous system , so that the average resting cardiac rate - - heart rate - persons with coronary artery disease . the heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node . it is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves . nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata . the cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves , and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve . during rest , both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart , contributing to autonomic tone . this is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles . normally , vagal stimulation - - heart rate - stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ach ) at the neuromuscular junction . ach slows hr by opening chemical - or ligand - gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization , which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs . without any nervous stimulation , the sa node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm . since resting rates are considerably less than this , it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows hr . this is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal . to speed up , one need merely remove one ’ s foot from - - heart arrhythmia - muscle cell firing off an impulse on its own . all of the cells in the heart have the ability to initiate an action potential ; however , only some of these cells are designed to routinely trigger heart beats . these cells are found in the conduction system of the heart and include the sa node , av node , bundle of his and purkinje fibers . the sinoatrial node is a single specialized location in the atrium that has a higher automaticity ( a faster pacemaker ) than the rest of the heart and , therefore , is usually responsible for setting the heart rate and initiating each heart - - cardiac pacemaker - cardiac pacemaker the contraction of cardiac muscle ( heart muscle ) in all	the heart rate

What is the name of the disease caused by group a beta - hemolytic the organism that causes strep throat ( gas ) ? \n - streptococcal pharyngitis - streptococcal pharyngitis streptococcal pharyngitis , also known as strep throat , is an infection of the back of the throat including the tonsils caused by " group a streptococcus " ( gas ) . common symptoms include fever , sore throat , red tonsils , and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck . a headache , and nausea or vomiting may also occur . some develop a sandpaper - like rash which is known as scarlet fever . symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days . strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person . it may be spread directly or by touching something that has droplets - - pharyngitis - " haemophilus influenzae " , " bordetella pertussis " , " bacillus anthracis " , " corynebacterium diphtheriae " , " neisseria gonorrhoeae " , " chlamydophila pneumoniae " , " mycoplasma pneumoniae " and " fusobacterium necrophorum " . streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is caused by group a beta - hemolytic streptococcus ( gas ) . it is the most common bacterial cause of cases of pharyngitis ( 15 – 30 % ) . common symptoms include fever , sore throat , and large lymph nodes . it is a contagious infection , spread by close contact with an infected individual . a definitive diagnosis is made based on the results of a throat culture . antibiotics are useful to both prevent complications and speed recovery . " fusobacterium necrophorum " is a normal inhabitant of the oropharyngeal flora and can - - streptococcus mitis - streptococcus mitis streptococcus mitis , previously known as streptococcus mitior , is a mesophilic alpha - hemolytic species of " streptococcus " that inhabits the human mouth . it is most commonly found in the throat , nasopharynx , and mouth . it is a gram - positive coccus , facultative anaerobe and catalase negative . it can cause infective endocarditis . it has been widely reported that this organism survived for over two years on the surveyor 3 probe on the moon ; but some nasa scientists suggest this may be a result of contamination during or after return of surveyor parts to earth . " s . mitis " is competent for natural genetic transformation . thus " s . mitis " - - throat irritation - the back of the throat or out of the nose . post - nasal drip can be caused by the common cold , allergies to dust , smoking , or pet dander . even spicy foods can sometimes cause post - nasal drip . runny nose is not life - threatening but can be uncomfortable and socially unacceptable . it is caused by bacteria which if untreated can lead to many other problems in the body . strep throat is most common in childhood but can affect people of all ages . it may present with throat pain , difficulty swallowing , painful and swollen tonsils , fever , headache , skin rash and flu . the diagnosis of strep throat - - group a streptococcal infection - non - invasive infections caused by gas tend to be less severe and more common . they occur when the bacteria colonizes the throat area , where it recognizes epithelial cells . the two most prominent infections of gas are both non - invasive : strep throat ( pharyngitis ) where it causes 15 - 30 % of the childhood cases and 10 % of adult cases ,	streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat
The motive for the modern usage of this method and the person used a question and answer method of arriving at important truths ' use is not necessarily what ? \n - socratic method - socratic method the socratic method , also known as maieutics , method of elenchus , elenctic method , or socratic debate , is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals , based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions . it is a dialectical method , involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned ; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way , thus weakening the defender ' s point . this method is named after the classical greek philosopher socrates and is introduced by him in plato ' s theaetetus as midwifery ( maieutics ) - - socratic method - a paradox , and began using the socratic method to answer his conundrum . diogenes laertius , however , wrote that protagoras invented the “ socratic ” method . plato famously formalized the socratic elenctic style in prose — presenting socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent athenian interlocutor — in some of his early dialogues , such as " euthyphro " and " ion " , and the method is most commonly found within the so - called " socratic dialogues " , which generally portray socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and epistemological issues . but in his later dialogues , such as theaetetus or sophist , plato had a different method to philosophical discussions , namely - - socratic questioning - socratic questioning socratic questioning ( or socratic maieutics ) was named after socrates , who was a philosopher in c . 470 bce – c . 399 bce . socrates utilized an educational method that focused on discovering answers by asking questions from his students . socrates believed that " the disciplined practice of thoughtful questioning enables the scholar / student to examine ideas and be able to determine the validity of those ideas " . plato , a student of socrates , described this rigorous method of teaching to explain that the teacher assumes an ignorant mindset in order to compel the student to assume the highest level of knowledge . thus , a student - - socratic method - " logos " ) and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances . in the second half of the 5th century bc , sophists were teachers who specialized in using the tools of philosophy and rhetoric to entertain , impress , or persuade an audience to accept the speaker ' s point of view . socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching which came to be called the socratic method . socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow athenians after his friend from youth , chaerephon , visited the oracle of delphi , which confirmed that no man in greece was wiser than socrates . socrates saw this as - - socratic method - with moral truth and moral understanding , that " wealth does not bring goodness , but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing , both to the individual and to the state " , and that " life without examination [ dialogue ] is not worth living " . it is with this in mind that the socratic method is employed . the motive for the modern usage of this method and socrates ' use are not necessarily equivalent . socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories , instead using myth to explain them . the parmenides dialogue	equivalent

What gene shows that the type of genes that prevent other genes from showing their phenotype can have an effect on the outcome of the phenotype ? \n - pleiotropy - pleiotropy pleiotropy ( from greek πλειων " pleion " , " more " , and τροπος " tropos " , " way " ) occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits . such a gene that exhibits multiple phenotypic expression is called a pleiotropic gene . therefore mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously due to the gene coding for a product used by a myriad of cells or different targets that have the same signaling function . pleiotropy can arise from several distinct but potentially overlapping mechanisms , such as gene pleiotropy , developmental pleiotropy , and selectional pleiotropy . gene pleiotropy occurs when a gene product - - silent mutation - it is reading in mrna . the mutated codons have a higher risk of making a mistake when splicing introns out of the mrna sequence leading to the wrong exons being produced . therefore , making a change to the mature messenger rna . mutations in the multi - drug resistance gene 1 show how silent mutations can have an effect on the outcome of the phenotype . silent mutation silent mutations are mutations in dna that do not have an observable effect on the organism ' s phenotype . they are a specific type of neutral mutation . the phrase " silent mutation " is often used interchangeably with the phrase " synonymous - - genetic screen - as extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression . suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways . a temperature sensitive screen involves performing temperature shifts to enhance a mutant phenotype . a population grown at low temperature would have a normal phenotype ; however , the mutation in the particular gene would make it unstable at a higher temperature . a screen for temperature sensitivity in fruit flies , for example , might involve raising the temperature in the cage until some flies faint , then opening a portal to let the others escape . individuals selected - - silent mutation - silent mutation silent mutations are mutations in dna that do not have an observable effect on the organism ' s phenotype . they are a specific type of neutral mutation . the phrase " silent mutation " is often used interchangeably with the phrase " synonymous mutation " ; however , synonymous mutations are not always silent , nor vice versa . synonymous mutations can affect transcription , splicing , mrna transport , and translation , any of which could alter phenotype , rendering the synonymous mutation non - silent . the substrate specificity of the trna to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation , and in turn the co - translational folding of the protein . this is reflected in - - gene silencing - gene silencing is considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes , such as rnai , crispr , or sirna , generally reduce the expression of a gene by at least 70 % but do not completely eliminate it . methods using gene silencing are often considered better than gene knockouts since they allow researchers to study essential genes that are required for the animal models to survive and cannot be removed . in addition , they provide a more complete view on the development of diseases since diseases are generally associated with genes that have a reduced expression . antisense oligonucleotides were discovered in	the multi - drug resistance gene 1

What is done during the last longer the mitotic phase or interphase ? \n - mitosis - interphase nuclei . during mitotic progression , typically after the anaphase onset , the cell may undergo cytokinesis . in animal cells , a cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells . in plant cells , a cell plate forms between the two nuclei . cytokinesis does not always occur ; coenocytic ( a type of multinucleate condition ) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis . the mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle . it alternates with the much longer " interphase " , where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division . interphase is divided into three phases : g ( first gap ) , s - - mitosis - mitosis in cell biology , mitosis ( ) is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei . cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained . in general , mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the s stage of interphase ( during which the dna is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis , which divides the cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( m ) phase of an animal cell - - mitosis - ( synthesis ) , and g ( second gap ) . during all three parts of interphase , the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles . however , chromosomes are replicated only during the s phase . thus , a cell grows ( g ) , continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes ( s ) , grows more and prepares for mitosis ( g ) , and finally divides ( m ) before restarting the cycle . all these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins , cyclin - dependent kinases , and other cell cycle proteins . the phases follow one another in strict order and there are " checkpoints " that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to - - cell cycle - an arrest in g . some cells enter the g phase semi - permanently and are considered post - mitotic , e . g . , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . many cells do not enter g and continue to divide throughout an organism ' s life , e . g . , epithelial cells . cellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to dna damage or degradation that would make a cell ' s progeny nonviable ; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self - destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis . before a cell can enter cell division , it needs to take in nutrients . all of the preparations are done during interphase . interphase is - - cell cycle - cells . in cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( m ) phase , and cytokinesis . during interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its dna . during the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . during the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells	all of the preparations

What is based on the findings of the study of the methods for protecting biodiversity called ? \n - conservation biology - species , pollution , human population , and overharvesting . the primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction ( such as deforestation , agricultural expansion , urban development ) , and overexploitation ( such as wildlife trade ) . habitat fragmentation also poses challenges , because the global network of protected areas only covers 11 . 5 % of the earth ' s surface . a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale . considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth , the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology . however , human activities need not necessarily cause - - natural resource management - relate to different kinds of " biodiversity organization " . according to gray ( p . 154 ) , the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity , was put forward by the united nations in 1992 , involving different aspects of biological diversity . the " threats " wreaking havoc on biodiversity include ; habitat fragmentation , putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources ; forest deterioration and deforestation ; the invasion of " alien species " and " climate change " ( p . 2 ) . since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public , the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management . according to cooney , there are material measures - - conservation biology - of an organism ' s natural habitat , such as on reservations or in gene banks , in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat . also , non - interference may be used , which is termed a preservationist method . preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans . in this regard , conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension , as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems . some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans . conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics - - conservation biology - of all species by 2050 , or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years . the current extinction rate is 100 - 100 , 000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years . conservation biology conservation biology is the management of nature and of earth ' s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species , their habitats , and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions . it is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences , and the practice of natural resource management . the conservation ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology . the term conservation biology and - - conservation biology - less than a year .

What is the location de novo synthesis of purine occur ? \n - nucleotide - nature and / or to synthesize an oligonucleotide . in vivo , nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways . the components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism , and from ammonia and carbon dioxide . the liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides . de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways . pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl - phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid , onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked . purines , however , are - - nucleic acid metabolism - are both primarily produced in the liver . they both contain a sugar and a phosphate , but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes . because of this , the two different groups are synthesized in different ways . however , all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide . adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines . in purine synthesis , prpp is turned into inosine monophosphate , or imp . production of imp from prpp requires glutamine , glycine , aspartate , and 6 atp , among other things . imp is then converted to amp ( adenosine - - purine nucleoside phosphorylase - nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . purine nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . pnp metabolizes inosine into hypoxanthine and guanosine into guanine , in each case creating ribose phosphate . note : adenosine is first metabolized to inosine via the enzyme adenosine deaminase . nucleoside phosphorylase is an enzyme which cleaves a nucleoside by phosphorylating the ribose to produce a nucleobase and ribose 1 phosphate . it is one enzyme of the nucleotide salvage pathways . these pathways allow the cell to produce nucleotide monophosphates when the " de novo " synthesis pathway has been interrupted or is non - existent ( as is the case in the brain ) . often - - de novo synthesis - beginning . " " de novo " pathways of nucleotides do not use free bases : adenine ( abbreviated as a ) , guanine ( g ) , cytosine ( c ) , thymine ( t ) , or uracil ( u ) . the purine ring is built up one atom or a few atoms at a time and attached to ribose throughout the process . pyrimidine ring is synthesized as orotate and attached to ribose phosphate and later converted to common pyrimidine nucleotides . " de novo " dna synthesis is dna replication without the need for precursor template dna . it ' s also referred to as artificial gene synthesis . primase is an rna polymerase , and it can add a primer to an existing - - biosynthesis - organisms . higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps . purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , which is the first key intermediate in purine base biosynthesis . < ref name = " kappock / purine " > < / ref > further enzymatic modification of imp produces the adenosine and guanosine bases of nucleotides . other dna and rna nucleotide bases that are linked to the ribose sugar via a glycosidic bond are thymine , cytosine and uracil ( which	the major organ of de novo synthesis

What is the majority of the mass of an atom found made of ? \n - atomic mass - atomic mass the atomic mass ( " m " ) is the mass of an atom . its unit is the unified atomic mass units ( symbol : u , or da ) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as of the mass of a single carbon - 12 atom , at rest . for atoms , the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass , and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number . when divided by unified atomic mass units or daltons to form a pure numeric ratio , the atomic mass of an atom becomes a dimensionless value - - atom - every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus . the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons . protons and neutrons are called nucleons . more than 99 . 94 % of an atom ' s mass is in the nucleus . the protons have a positive electric charge , the electrons have a negative electric charge , and the neutrons have no electric charge . if the number of protons and electrons are equal , that atom is electrically neutral . if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons , then it has an overall negative - - atomic nucleus - atomic nucleus the atomic nucleus is the small , dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom , discovered in 1911 by ernest rutherford based on the 1909 geiger – marsden gold foil experiment . after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by dmitri ivanenko and werner heisenberg . an atom is composed of a positively - charged nucleus , with a cloud of negatively - charged electrons surrounding it , bound together by electrostatic force . almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus , with a very small contribution - - mass number - number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( " n " ) in a given nucleus : . the mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element ' s symbol . for example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . the full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( " z " ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : - - atom - center of mass , although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point - like and cannot be said to be rotating . spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant ( ħ ) , with electrons , protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ , or " spin - ½ " . in an atom , electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin , while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin . the magnetic field produced by an atom — its magnetic moment — is determined by these various forms of	one or more protons and typically

What is the web based the type of information system manages a document through all the stages of its processing software becoming ? \n - document management system - lets a user manage access , track and edit information stored . document management software is an electronic cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files . the software helps the businesses to combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned and digital formats gets imported . web based document management software are becoming the staple of the industry . there are many document management software systems available today to manage information in well structured form of data storage and for future archiving such as ineight , archivista , aconex , scenario advantage enterprise content management , - - document management system - damage to a business ' s reputation . the following are important aspects of document control : integrated document management comprises the technologies , tools , and methods used to capture , manage , store , preserve , deliver and dispose of ' documents ' across an enterprise . in this context ' documents ' are any of a myriad of information assets including images , office documents , graphics , and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as web pages , email , instant messages , and video . paper documents have long been used in storing information . however , paper can be costly and , if used excessively , wasteful . document management software is not simply a tool but it - - document automation - arrival acknowledgement forms / reports of many types ( e . g . msds , damaged goods , returned goods , detailed / summary , etc . ) , import / export , delivery , bill of lading ( bol ) , etc . these documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor , so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary , like a third party logistics company ( 3pl ) and governments . document handling within logistics , supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi - automatically using bar code scanners , software and tabletop laser printers . there are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order - - information repository - solutions because of the concurrent deployment of diverse storage technologies running diverse operating systems . they feature centralized management for all deployed data storage resources . they are self - contained , support heterogeneous storage resources , support resource management to add , maintain , recycle , and terminate media , track of off - line media , and operate autonomously . since one of the main reasons for the implementation of an information repository is to reduce the maintenance workload placed on it staff by traditional data storage systems , information repositories are automated . automation is accomplished via policies that can process data based on time , events , data age , and data content . policies manage - - process management ( computing ) - are when one suspends execution while debugging a program , or when the system is monitoring processes . for the five - state process management model , consider the following transitions described in the next sections . each process in the system is represented by a data structure called a process control block ( pcb ) , or process descriptor in linux , which performs the same function as a traveller ' s passport . the pcb contains the basic information	the staple of the industry
What is another method for measuring the initial product of the transcription process abundance ? \n - transcription ( biology ) - the transcription produces messenger rna ( mrna ) ; the mrna , in turn , serves as a template for the protein ' s synthesis through translation . alternatively , the transcribed gene may encode for non - coding rna such as microrna , ribosomal rna ( rrna ) , transfer rna ( trna ) , or enzymatic rna molecules called ribozymes . overall , rna helps synthesize , regulate , and process proteins ; it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ; this single - stranded template is called cdna . the	rt - qpcr

What was the white dress considered by elite brides at the end of the time brides start wearing white wedding dresses ? \n - wedding dress - wedding dress a wedding dress or wedding / bridal gown is the clothing worn by a bride during a wedding ceremony . color , style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants . in western cultures , brides often choose white wedding dress , which was made popular by queen victoria in the 19th century . in eastern cultures , brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness . weddings performed during and immediately following the middle ages were often more than just a union between two people . they could be a union between two families , two businesses or even two - - white wedding - that decorous brides were naturally too timid to show their faces in public until they were married . by the end of the 19th century the white dress was the garment of choice for elite brides on both sides of the atlantic . however , middle - class british and american brides did not adopt the trend fully until after world war ii . with increased prosperity in the 20th century , the tradition also grew to include the practice of wearing the dress only once . as historian vicky howard writes , " [ i ] f a bride wore white in the nineteenth century , it was acceptable and likely that she - - bridesmaid - production of an heir . brides were susceptible to kidnapping at weddings by rival clans and hooligans . shouldering the responsibility to protect the bride , bridesmaids were dressed up like the bride to lower the risk that she might be identified and robbed . as legal protections for marriage were established , this was no longer necessary , and the role of bridesmaid took a more symbolic turn . in the victorian era , white was the official color for both male groomsmen and female bridesmaids . this trend originated with queen victoria when she married prince albert wearing a long white wedding dress , and her bridesmaids matched - - weddings in the united states - parents of the groom . the announcement of the newly married couple took place at their church on the sunday following the wedding . in the 1820s and 1830s , weddings became more elaborate , when upper class couples had wedding ceremonies similar to modern custom . the bride usually wore the best dress she owned , so her dress was not always white , as white dresses were impractical to own . not until the middle of the 19th century did brides start buying a dress made specifically for their wedding day . at the same time , couples began to hire professionals to prepare floral arrangements and wedding - - white wedding - white wedding a white wedding is a traditional formal or semi - formal wedding originating in great britain . the term originates from the white colour of the wedding dress , which first became popular with victorian era elites after queen victoria wore a white lace dress at her wedding . the term now also encapsulates the entire western wedding routine , especially in the christian religious tradition , which generally includes a ceremony during which the marriage begins , followed by a reception . though mary , queen of scots , wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband , francis dauphin of france , the tradition - - white - culture most often associated with beginnings and the new .	the garment of choice
What does " the thing you call the land portion of the earth " refer to ? \n - earth - that the world ' s human population will reach 9 . 2 billion in 2050 . most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations . human population density varies widely around the world , but a majority live in asia . by 2020 , 60 % of the world ' s population is expected to be living in urban , rather than rural , areas . it is estimated that one - eighth of earth ' s surface is suitable for humans to live on – three - quarters of earth ' s surface is covered by oceans , leaving one - quarter as land . half of that land area is desert ( 14 % ) , high mountains ( 27 % ) , or other unsuitable terrains . the northernmost - - earth - . at the other extreme , the slowest - moving plate is the eurasian plate , progressing at a typical rate of . the total surface area of earth is about . of this , 70 . 8 % , or , is below sea level and covered by ocean water . below the ocean ' s surface are much of the continental shelf , mountains , volcanoes , oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus , abyssal plains , and a globe - spanning mid - ocean ridge system . the remaining 29 . 2 % , or , not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains , deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms . tectonics and erosion , volcanic - - land - by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor . the origin of the world ' s oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids , proto - planets , and comets . in this model , atmospheric " greenhouse gases " kept the oceans from freezing while the newly forming sun was only at 70 % luminosity . by , the earth ' s magnetic field was established , which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind . the atmosphere and oceans of the earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface . the crust , which currently forms the earth ' s land , was created when - - land - the molten outer layer of the planet earth cooled to form a solid mass as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere . once land became capable of supporting life , biodiversity evolved over hundreds of million years , expanding continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions . the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present - day forms or , more likely , a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long - term steady continental area . continents formed by plate tectonics , a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the earth ' s interior . on - - land - time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years , the supercontinents have formed and broken apart three times . roughly ( million years ago ) , one of the earliest known supercontinents , rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600 – , then finally pangaea , which also broke apart .

Neurons in the hearing center of the brain located are organized according to what ? \n - auditory cortex - for immediate tonal arrangements in this respect . rmpfc is a subsection of the medial prefrontal cortex , which projects to many diverse areas including the amygdala , and is thought to aid in the inhibition of negative emotion . auditory cortex the auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and other vertebrates . it is a part of the auditory system , performing basic and higher functions in hearing , such as possible relations to language switching . it is located bilaterally , roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes – in humans on the superior temporal plane , - - auditory cortex - auditory cortex the auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and other vertebrates . it is a part of the auditory system , performing basic and higher functions in hearing , such as possible relations to language switching . it is located bilaterally , roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes – in humans on the superior temporal plane , within the lateral fissure and comprising parts of heschl ' s gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus , including planum polare and planum temporale ( roughly brodmann areas 41 , 42 , and partially 22 ) . unilateral destruction , in a region of the - - auditory cortex - we already have suggests that no two cortices work in precisely the same way . " in the hearing process , multiple sounds are transduced simultaneously . the role of the auditory system is to decide which components form the sound link . many have surmised that this linkage is based on the location of sounds . however , there are numerous distortions of sound when reflected off different media , which makes this thinking unlikely . the auditory cortex forms groupings based on fundamentals ; in music , for example , this would include harmony , timing , and pitch . the primary auditory cortex lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal - - auditory cortex - lobe and extends into the lateral sulcus and the transverse temporal gyri ( also called " heschl ' s gyri " ) . final sound processing is then performed by the parietal and frontal lobes of the human cerebral cortex . animal studies indicate that auditory fields of the cerebral cortex receive ascending input from the auditory thalamus , and that they are interconnected on the same and on the opposite cerebral hemispheres . the auditory cortex is composed of fields which differ from each other in both structure and function . the number of fields varies in different species , from as few as 2 in rodents to as many as - - auditory cortex - methods . damage to the auditory cortex in humans leads to a loss of any awareness of sound , but an ability to react reflexively to sounds remains as there is a great deal of subcortical processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain . neurons in the auditory cortex are organized according to the frequency of sound to which they respond best . neurons at one end of the auditory cortex respond best to low frequencies ; neurons at the other respond best to high frequencies . there are multiple auditory areas ( much like the multiple areas in the visual cortex ) , which can be distinguished anatomically - - auditory system - nucleus is part of the thalamic relay system .	the frequency of sound

What is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in the primary component of the cytosol ? \n - cytosol - a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space . in eukaryotes , while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol , others take place within organelles . the cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water . although water forms the large majority of the cytosol , its structure and properties within cells is not well understood . the concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid ; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation , cell signaling , and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such - - cytosol - mass of less than 300 da . this mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex , as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism ( the metabolites ) is immense . for example , up to 200 , 000 different small molecules might be made in plants , although not all these will be present in the same species , or in a single cell . estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as " e . coli " and baker ' s yeast predict that under 1 , 000 are made . most of the cytosol is water , which makes up about 70 % of the total volume of a typical cell . the ph - - cytosol - " aqueous cytoplasm " has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells . prior to this , other terms , including " hyaloplasm " , were used for the cell fluid , not always synonymously , as its nature was not very clear ( see protoplasm ) . the proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies : for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria , in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole . the cytosol consists mostly of water , dissolved ions , small molecules , and large water - soluble molecules ( such as proteins ) . the majority of these non - protein molecules have a molecular - - cytosol - out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70 % below normal . although water is vital for life , the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood , mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water , and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale . even the structure of pure water is poorly understood , due to the ability of water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds . the classic view of water in cells is that about 5 % of this water is strongly - - cytoplasm - cytoplasm in cell biology , the cytoplasm is all of the material within a cell , enclosed by the cell membrane , except for the cell nucleus . the material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm . the main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol – a gel - like substance , the organelles – the cell ' s internal sub - structures , and various cytoplasmic inclusions . the cytoplasm is about 80 % water and usually colorless . the submicroscopic ground cell substance , or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm . it is the hyaloplasm of	the cytosol

What movement did the social elite lead in the time the education reform start in america ? \n - history of education in the united states - designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern , industrial society . in terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction , a doubling of the period of schooling , and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth . the social elite in many cities in the 1890s led the reform movement . their goal was to permanently end political party control of the local schools for the benefit of patronage jobs and construction contracts , which had arisen out of ward politics that absorbed and taught the millions of new immigrants . new york city elite led progressive reforms . - - history of education in the united states - the colonies . in new york , the medical department of king ' s college was established in 1767 , and in 1770 it awarded the first american m . d . degree . after the revolution , northern states especially emphasized education and rapidly established public schools . by the year 1870 , all states had tax - subsidized elementary schools . the us population had one of the highest literacy rates in the world at the time . private academies also flourished in the towns across the country , but rural areas ( where most people lived ) had few schools before the 1880s . in 1821 , boston started the first public high school in the united states . - - history of education in the united states - had compulsory schooling laws ; four were in the south . 30 states with compulsory schooling laws required attendance until age 14 ( or higher ) . as a result , by 1910 , 72 percent of american children attended school . half the nation ' s children attended one - room schools . by 1918 , every state required students to complete elementary school . as the nation was majority protestant in the 19th century , most states passed a constitutional amendment , called blaine amendments , forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools . this was largely directed against catholics , as the heavy immigration from catholic ireland after the 1840s aroused nativist sentiment . there were - - history of education in the united states - of a larger progressive movement , extending from the 1890s to the 1930s . the era was notable for a dramatic expansion in the number of schools and students served , especially in the fast - growing metropolitan cities . after 1910 , smaller cities also began building high schools . by 1940 , 50 % of young adults had earned a high school diploma . radical historians in the 1960s , steeped in the anti - bureaucratic ethos of the new left , deplored the emergence of bureaucratic school systems . they argue its purpose was to suppress the upward aspirations of the working class . but other historians have emphasized the necessity of building non - politicized - - history of education in the united states - of school systems across the state . some scholars believe that transformation of the pell grant program to a loan program in the early 1980s has caused an increase in the gap between the growth rates of white , asian - american and african - american college graduates since the 1970s . others believe the issue is increasingly related more to class and family capacity than ethnicity . some school systems have used economics to create a different way	the reform movement

What is mainly digested in the location trans fats go in the body ? \n - digestion - that move along the stomach wall . this allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes . after some time ( typically 1 – 2 hours in humans , 4 – 6 hours in dogs , 3 – 4 hours in house cats ) , the resulting thick liquid is called chyme . when the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues . when the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood . 95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small - - digestion - proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids . the digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens . for example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin . trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides . digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides . however fats are mainly digested in the small intestine . the presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate - - trans fat - trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted , forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above . the exact biochemical process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research . intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body ' s ability to metabolize essential fatty acids ( efas , including omega - 3 ) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta , the main artery of the heart , thereby raising risk of coronary artery disease . while the mechanisms through which trans fatty acids contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood , the mechanism for their effects on diabetes is - - lipid metabolism - intestinal wall . in the epithelial cells , fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body . digestion is the first step to lipid metabolism , and it is the process of breaking the triglycerides down into smaller monoglyceride units with the help of lipase enzymes . digestion of fats begin in the mouth through chemical digestion by lingual lipase . ingested cholesterol is not broken down by the lipases and stays intact until it enters the epithelium cells of small intestine . lipids then continue to the stomach where chemical digestion continues by gastric lipase and mechanical digestion begins ( peristalsis ) . the majority - - glycogen - store roughly 100 – 120 grams of glycogen . in skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1 – 2 % of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen . the amount of glycogen stored in the body — particularly within the muscles and liver — mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits . small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain . the uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo . approximately 4 - -	fats
What is formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells of large lipids packaged in chylomicrons for absorption ? \n - triglyceride - the bond and " releasing " the fatty acid . in triglyceride form , lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum . fatty acids , monoglycerides ( one glycerol , one fatty acid ) , and some diglycerides are absorbed by the duodenum , once the triglycerides have been broken down . in the intestine , following the secretion of lipases and bile , triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis . they are subsequently moved to absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines . the triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons . these are excreted from the - - chylomicron - chylomicron chylomicrons ( from the greek χυλος , chylos , meaning " juice " ( of plants or animals ) , and micron , meaning " small particle " ) are lipoprotein particles that consist of triglycerides ( 85 – 92 % ) , phospholipids ( 6 – 12 % ) , cholesterol ( 1 – 3 % ) , and proteins ( 1 – 2 % ) . they transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body . chylomicrons are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins : chylomicrons ( a . k . a . uldl ultra low - density lipoprotein relative to surrounding water ) , very low - density lipoprotein , intermediate - density lipoprotein , low - density lipoprotein , high - density lipoprotein , that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water - based solution of the bloodstream . chylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to adipose , cardiac , and - - blood lipids - normal blood cholesterol , 200 – 239 mg / dl borderline - high , > 240 mg / dl high cholesterol . the average amount of " blood cholesterol " varies with age , typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old . there appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans , more , on average , in winter . these seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to vitamin c intake . in lipid digestion , cholesterol is packed into chylomicrons in the small intestine , which are delivered to the portal vein and lymph . the chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver hepatocytes via interaction between apolipoproteine and the ldl receptor or lipoprotein receptor - related proteins . cholesterol - - chylomicron - skeletal muscle tissue , where their triglyceride components are hydrolyzed by the activity of the lipoprotein lipase , allowing the released free fatty acids to be absorbed by the tissues . when a large portion of the triacylglycerol core have been hydrolyzed , chylomicron remnants are formed and are taken up by the liver , thereby also transferring dietary fat to the liver . chylomicrons are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells ( enterocytes ) of the small intestine . the villi , lined with the microvilli of the brush border , provide a lot of surface area for absorption . newly formed chylomicrons are secreted through the basolateral - - chylomicron - of fatty acids and monoglycerides . these then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte , where they are re - esterified to form triglycerides . the triglycerides are then combined with phospholipids , cholesteryl esters , and apolipoprotein b - 48 to form a nascent chylomicron . these are then released by exocytosis from the enterocytes	chylomicrons
