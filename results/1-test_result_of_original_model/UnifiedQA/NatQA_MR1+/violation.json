- heart rate - stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ach ) at the neuromuscular junction . ach slows hr by opening chemical - or ligand - gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization , which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs . without any nervous stimulation , the sa node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm . since resting rates are considerably less than this , it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows hr . this is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal . to speed up , one need merely remove one ’ s foot from -
