over - - desalination - present above the liquid . the compressed vapor is then used to provide the heat needed for the evaporation of the rest of the sea water . since this system only requires power , it is more cost effective if kept at a small scale . the leading process for desalination in terms of installed capacity and yearly growth is reverse osmosis ( ro ) . the ro membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied pressure ( on the membrane feed side ) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts . reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes . desalination processes - - desalination - be treated and used again . salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater , and in areas near the ocean , seawater could be treated . the passarell process uses reduced atmospheric pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination . the pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor . the compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber . the compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister ( removing residual impurities ) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber", "declarative_sentence": "reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes .", "target_answer": "reverse osmosis", "new_question": "What type of plant membrane system uses less energy than thermal process that allows liquid water to return to the earth from the atmosphere processes ?", "new_answer": "reverse osmosis", "rouge_1_p": "0.7142857142857143", "rouge_1_r": "0.7692307692307693", "index": "6607", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "1.0", "similar_scores": "[1.0000001, 1.0]"}, {"source_question": "who is clay wife on one tree hill?", "ground_truth": "Sara", "source_answer": "gemma", "article": "- gemma teller morrow -

it therefore plays a fundamental role in performing functions within a cell . in virology , the term may also be used when referring to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule ( i . e . , rna replication ) . for instance , the genome of a negative - sense single - stranded rna ( ssrna - ) virus may be template for - - transcription ( biology ) - transcription ( biology ) transcription is the first step of gene expression , in which a particular segment of dna is copied into rna ( especially mrna ) by the enzyme rna polymerase . both dna and rna are nucleic acids , which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary language . during transcription , a dna sequence is read by an rna polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel rna strand called a primary transcript . transcription proceeds in the following general steps : the stretch of dna transcribed into an rna molecule is called a " transcription unit " and encodes at least one gene . if the gene encodes a protein , - - primary transcript - types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products . furthermore , primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mrnas . the processing of pre - mrna in eukaryotic cells includes 5 ' capping , 3 ' polyadenylation , and alternative splicing . shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes , a pre - mrna ' s 5 ' end is modified by the addition of a 7 - methylguanosine cap , also known as a 5 ' cap . the 5 ' capping modification is initiated by the addition of a gtp to the 5 ' terminal nucleotide of the pre - mrna in reverse orientation followed - - eukaryotic transcription - next phase of transcription : elongation . transcription elongation is a processive process . double stranded dna that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for rna synthesis . for every dna base pair separated by the advancing polymerase , one hybrid rna : dna base pair is immediately formed . dna strands and nascent rna chain exit from separate channels ; the two dna strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand rna emerges alone . among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors , thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation . there are different classes - - gene expression - it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel . on the other hand , the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts . another approach for measuring mrna abundance is rt - qpcr . in this technique , reverse transcription is followed by quantitative pcr . reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ;
